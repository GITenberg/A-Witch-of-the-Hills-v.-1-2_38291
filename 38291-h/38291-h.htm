<h2>A WITCH OF THE HILLS</h2>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I</h2>

<p>Poor little witch! I think she left all her
spells and love-philters behind her, when she
let herself be carried off from Ballater to
Bayswater, a spot where no sorcery more
poetical or more interesting than modern
Spiritualism finds a congenial home. What
was her star about not to teach her that
human hearts can beat as passionately up
among the quiet hills and the dark fir-forests
as down amid the rattle and the roar of the
town? Well, well; it is only in the grave<span class="pagenum">[2]</span>
that we make no mistakes; and life and
love, God knows, are mysteries beyond the
ken of a chuckle-headed country gentleman,
with just sense enough to handle a gun and
land a salmon.</p>

<p>And the sum and substance of all this is
that the Deeside hills are very bleak in
December, that the north wind sighs and
sobs, whistles and howls among the ragged
firs and the bending larches in a manner
fearsome and eerie to a lonely man at his
silent fireside, and that books are but sorry
substitutes for human companions when the
deer are safe in their winter retreat in the
forests, and the grouse-moors are white with
snow. So here's for another pine-log on the
fire, and a glance back at the fourteen years
which have slipped away since I shut the
gates of the world behind me.</p>

<p>The world! The old leaven is still there
then, that after fourteen years of voluntary<span class="pagenum">[3]</span>&mdash;almost
voluntary&mdash;exile, I still call that
narrow circle of a few hundreds of not particularly
wise, not particularly interesting
people&mdash;the world! They were wise enough
and interesting enough for me at three and
twenty, though, when by the death of my
elder brother I leapt at once from an irksome
struggle, with expensive tastes, on a stingy
allowance of three hundred a year, to the full
enjoyment of an income of eight thousand.</p>

<p>How fully I appreciated the delights of
that sudden change from 'ineligible' to
'eligible!' How quickly I began to feel
that, in accepting an invitation, instead of
receiving a favour I now conferred one! My
new knowledge speedily transformed a harmless
and rather obliging young man into an
insufferable puppy; but the puppy was
welcomed where the obliging young man
had hardly been tolerated. Beautifully
gradual the change was, both in me and<span class="pagenum">[4]</span>
in my friends; for we were all well bred,
and knew how to charge the old formulas
with new meaning. 'You will be sure to
come, won't you?' from a hostess to me,
was no longer a crumb of kindness, it was
an entreaty. 'You are very kind,' from me,
expressed now not gratitude, but condescension.
A rather nice girl, who had been
scolded for dancing with me too often, was
now, like the little children sent out in the
streets to beg, praised or blamed by her
mother according to the degree of attention
I had paid her. I did not share the contempt
of the other men of my own age for
this man&oelig;uvring mamma and the rest of her
kind, though I daresay I spoke of them in
the same tone as they did. In the first
place, I was flattered by their homage to
my new position, interested as it was; and
in the second, in their presence we were all
so much alike, in dress, manner, and what<span class="pagenum">[5]</span>
by courtesy is called conversation, that the
poor ladies might well be excused for judging
our merits by the only tangible point of
difference&mdash;our relative wealth.</p>

<p>In our tastes, our vices, real or assumed,
there was equally little to choose between us.
We knew little about art and less about
literature. In politics we were dogged and
illogical partisans of politicians, and cared
nothing for principles. Religion we left to
women, who shared with horses the chief
place in our thoughts. Nature having fortunately
denied to the latter animals the power
of speech, there was no danger of the two
classes of our favourites coming into active
rivalry.</p>

<p>In the intoxication of early manhood,
while the mind was still in the background
to the senses, the surface of things provided
entertainment enough for us. Characters
and even characteristics were merged in a<span class="pagenum">[6]</span>
uniformity of folly without malice, and vice
without depravity. If we gambled, we lost
money which did no good while in our
hands; if we gave light love, it was to ladies
who asked for no more; if we drank, we only
clouded intellects which were never employed
in thought.</p>

<p>Looking back on that time from the
serene eminence of nine and thirty, I can
see that I was a fool, but also that I got my
money's worth for my folly, which is more
than I can say for all my later aberrations
of intellect. And if, on the brink of forty,
I find I can give a less logical account of
my actions and feelings than I could at the
opening of life, it is appalling to think what
a consummate ass I may be if I live another
twenty years! I begin to wish I had set
myself some less humiliating task, to fill my
lonely hours by a mountain winter fireside,
than this of tracing the process by which the<span class="pagenum">[7]</span>
idiot of five and twenty became the lunatic of
five and thirty. Well, it's too late to go
back, now that I have called up the old
ghosts and felt again the terrible fascination
of the touch of the now gaunt fingers. So
here's for a dash at my work with the best
grace I can.</p>

<p>I had been enjoying my accession to
fortune for about eighteen months, during
which I had devoted what mind and soul I
possessed wholly to the work of catering for
the gratification of my senses, when I fell for
the first time seriously in love, as the natural
sequence of having exhausted the novelty of
coarser excitements.</p>

<p>Lady Helen Normanton was the third
daughter of the Marquis of Castleford, a
beauty in her first season, who had made a
sensation on her presentation, and had attracted
the avowed admiration of no less a
person than the Earl of Saxmundham, such<span class="pagenum">[8]</span>
a great catch, with his rumoured revenues of
eighty or ninety thousand a year, that for a
comparative pauper with a small and already
encumbered estate like mine to dare to
appear in the lists against him seemed the
height of conceit or the depth of idiotcy.
But Lady Helen's eyes were bright enough,
and her smile sweet enough, to turn any
man's head. They caused me to form the
first set purpose of my life, and I dashed into
my wooing with a head-long earnestness that
soon made my passion the talk of my friends.
I had one advantage on my side upon which
I must confess that I largely relied; I was
good-looking enough to have earned the
sobriquet of 'Handsome Harry,' and I was
quite as much alive to my personal attractions,
quite as anxious to show them to the
best advantage, as any female professional
beauty. It was agony to think that, having
already exhausted my imagination in the<span class="pagenum">[9]</span>
invention of devices by which, in the restricted
area of man's costume, I should
always appear a little better dressed than
any one else, I could do nothing more for my
love than I had done for my vanity. As a
last resource I curled my hair.</p>

<p>The boldness of my devotion soon began
to tell. The Earl of Saxmundham was fifty-two,
had a snub nose, and was already bald.
Lady Helen was very young, sweet and
simple, and perhaps scarcely realised yet
what much handsomer horses and gowns and
diamonds are to be got with eighty thousand
a year than with eight. So she smiled at
me and danced with me, and said nothing at
all in the sweetest way when I poured out
my passion in supper-rooms and conservatories,
and giggled with the most adorable
childlikeness when I kissed her little hand,
still young enough to be rather red, and told
her that she had inspired me with the wish<span class="pagenum">[10]</span>
to be great for her sake. And the end of it
was that the Earl began to retreat, and that
I was snubbed, and that these snubs, being
to me an earnest of victory, I became ten
times more openly, outrageously daring than
before, and my suit being vigorously upheld
by one of her brothers, who had become an
oracle in the family on the simple basis of
being difficult to please, I was at last most
reluctantly accepted as Lady Helen's betrothed
lover.</p>

<p>My success gave me the sort of prestige
of curiosity which passionate earnestness, in
this age when we associate passion with
seedy Bohemians and earnestness with Methodist
preachers, can easily excite among a
generation of men who, having no stimulating
iron bars or stone walls between them
and their lady-loves, can reserve the best of
their energies for other and more exciting
pursuits. I was the respectable Paris to a<span class="pagenum">[11]</span>
proper and perfectly well-conducted Helen,
the Romeo to a new Juliet. My wooing and
engagement became a society topic, the subject
of many interesting fictions. Spreading
to circles a little more remote, in the absence
of any Downing Street blunder or Clapham
tragedy, the story became more romantic
still. I myself overheard on the Underground
Railway the exciting narration of
how I forced my way at night into the
Marquis's bedroom, after having concealed
myself for some hours behind a Japanese
screen in the library; how, revolver in hand,
I had forced the unwilling parent to accede
to my demand for his daughter's hand, and
much more of the same kind, listened to with
incredulity, but still with interest.</p>

<p>It was hard that, after the <i>&eacute;clat</i> of such a
beginning, our engagement should have continued
on commonplace lines, but so it did.
My love for this fair girl, being the first deep<span class="pagenum">[12]</span>
emotion of a life which had begun to pall
upon me by its frivolity, had struck far down
and moved to life within me the best feelings
of a man's nature. I began to be ashamed
of myself, to feel that I was a futile coxcomb,
only saved from being ridiculous by being
one of a crowd of others like me. I gave up
betting, that I might have more money to
spend on presents for her; less legitimate
pleasures I renounced as a matter of course,
with shame that the arms which were to
protect my darling should have been so profaned;
vanity having made me a 'masher,'
love made me a man. Unluckily, Helen
was too young and too innocent to appreciate
the difference; her eyes still glowed at the
sight of French bonbons, she liked compliments
better than conversation, and burst
into tears when one evening, as she was
dressed for a ball, I broke, in kissing her,
the heads of some lilies of the valley she was<span class="pagenum">[13]</span>
wearing. The little petulant push she gave
me opened my eyes to the fact that no sooner
had I discovered myself to be a fool in one
way than I had straightway fallen into as
great an error in another direction. It
dawned upon me for the first time, as I sat
opposite to Helen and her mother in the
barouche on our way to the ball, what a
horrible likeness there was, seen in this halflight
of the carriage lamps, between Helen
with her sweet blue eyes and features so
delicately lovely that they made one think
of Queen Titania, with an uncomfortable
thought of one's self as the ass, and the placid
Marchioness, whose features at other times
one never noticed, so utterly insignificant a
nonentity was she by reason of the vacuous
stolidity which was carried by her to the
point of absolute distinction. Would Helen
be like that at forty? Worse still, was
Helen like that now? It was a horrible<span class="pagenum">[14]</span>
thought, which subsequent experience unhappily
did not tend to dispel. My first
serious love had worked too great a revolution
in me, had made me conscious of needs
unfelt before, so that I now found that mere
innocence in the woman who was to be the
goddess of my life was not enough; I must
have capacity for thought, for passion.</p>

<p>All this I had taken for granted at first,
while the struggle to win her occupied all my
energies; but when from the mad aspirant I
became the proud betrothed, I had leisure to
find out that the beautiful, dreamy, far-away
eyes of my <i>fianc&eacute;e</i> in no way denoted a
poetic temperament, that her romance consisted
merely in the preference for a handsome
face to an ugly one, and in the inability
to understand that she, an Earl's daughter
and a spoilt child, could by any possibility
fail to obtain anything to which she had
taken a fancy. I was surprised at the<span class="pagenum">[15]</span>
rapidity with which I, a man seriously and
deeply in love, came to these conclusions
about the girl who had inspired my passion.
I could even, looking into the future, foretell
the kind of life we should lead together as
man and wife, when she, fallen from the ideal
position of inspiring goddess to that of a
tame pet rabbit, bored to death by my
solemnity when I was serious, and frightened
by my impetuosity when I was gay, would
discover, with quick woman's instinct, that
the best of myself was no longer given to
her, and cavilling at the neglect of a husband
whose society oppressed her, would find compensation
for her wrongs among more frivolous
companions. So that, weary of frivolity
myself, my wife would avenge my defection.</p>

<p>I suppose almost every man, in the sober
hours which alternate with the paroxysms of
the wildest passions, can form a tolerably
correct forecast of his life with the woman<span class="pagenum">[16]</span>
who likes to believe that she has cast him
into an infatuation whose force is blinding.
The picture is always with him, showing now
in bright colours, now in dark; varying a
little in its outlines from time to time, but
remaining substantially the same, and more
or less accurate according to the measure of
his intellect and experience; not at all the
picture of even an earthly paradise, but yet
with charms which satisfy human longings,
and make it hard to part with. So I, having
made up my mind that beauty, gentleness
and modesty, good birth and fairly good
temper were the only attributes of my future
wife on which I could rely, philosophically
decided that they formed as good an equipment
as I had any right to expect, doubled
my offerings of flowers and bonbons, and
transferred the disquisitions on art, literature,
religion and politics, in which I had begun to
indulge, to her brother.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[17]</span></p>

<p>Lord Edgar Normanton was a tall, fair,
broad-shouldered young man, who, while
joining in all the frivolous amusements of his
age and station, did so in a grave, leisurely,
and reflective manner, which caused him to
be looked up to as one capable of higher
things, whose presence at a cricket match
was a condescension, and who appeared at
balls with some occult purpose connected
with the study of human nature. I had
always looked upon his special friendship for
me as an honour, of which I felt that my
new departure, in deciding that I had sown
wild oats enough, made me more worthy.
It never occurred to me to ask myself or
anybody else whether his wild oats were
sown. It was enough for me that he was
glad when mine were. With the loyalty of
most young men to their ideals of their own
sex, I would far rather have discovered a
new and unsuspected flaw in Helen's character<span class="pagenum">[18]</span>
than have learnt anything to shake my
respect for her brother. Women, when not
considered as angels, can only be looked
upon as fascinating but inferior creatures,
whose faults must be overlooked as irremediable,
in consideration of their contributions
to the comfort or the pleasure of man.
One may argue about them, but, except as a
relaxation, one cannot argue with them.</p>

<p>Edgar was openly delighted at my engagement
with his sister, which he considered
merely in the light of a tie to bring
us two men closer together. Such a little
nonentity as I found he considered his sister
to be might think herself lucky to be
honoured by such a use.</p>

<p>This was the position of affairs when a
memorable shooting party in Norfolk, of which
both Edgar and I formed members, resulted
in an accident which was to bring my love affair
to an end as sensational as its beginning.</p>

</div>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</h2>

<p>We were engaged upon that hospitable
abomination at a shooting party&mdash;a champagne
luncheon. Having made a very fair
bag for my morning's work, and being tired
with my exertions, I was inclined to think that
the serious business of the day was over for
me, and that I might take it easy as regarded
further effort. Edgar, who, since his discovery
that my fervour on the subject of his
sister had grown less ardent, was inclined to
assume more of the character of mentor
towards me than I cared about, had seated
himself on the ground beside me; but I had
found an opportunity of changing seats, for<span class="pagenum">[20]</span>
I felt less well-disposed towards him that
morning than I had ever been before.</p>

<p>The fact was that the gentle Helen had
snubbed me two evenings previously for a
demonstration of affection which I had carefully
prepared, lest she, too, should have
noticed the waning in my love. Upon this
I had retreated, with a very odd mixture of
feelings towards my <i>fianc&eacute;e</i>, and there had
been a reserve between us for the whole of
the evening, which Edgar somewhat unwisely
interfered to break. Looking upon myself
as the injured person, I had resented the
homily he felt himself called upon to administer,
and though I made my peace with
Helen next day, I avoided her brother.
He made two or three good-natured overtures
to me in the manner of an experienced
nurse to a froward child, but on the morning
of the shooting party I was still as far as
ever from being reconciled to the paternal<span class="pagenum">[21]</span>
intervention of Edgar the Wise and the
Good.</p>

<p>'The Ladies!' cried one of the party,
leaning lazily back on his arm and raising his
glass.</p>

<p>'Say "Woman,"' I amended; 'it's more
comprehensive.'</p>

<p>'Well, but "The Ladies!" ought to be
comprehensive enough for you just now,
Maude,' said some one, glancing mischievously
at Edgar, whose solemnity was increasing,
and scenting something warmer
than controversy.</p>

<p>'Not now, nor ever!' said I, with more
daring than good taste. 'In "Woman" we
can secretly worship an ideal better than
ourselves. In "The Ladies" we must bow
down to creatures lower than ourselves,
whose beauty deceives us, whose frivolity
degrades us, and whom nothing more sacred
than our care and their own coldness protects<span class="pagenum">[22]</span>
from the fate of fellow-women whom
before them we do not dare to name.'</p>

<p>Everybody looked up in astonishment,
and Edgar's red healthy face became purple
with anger.</p>

<p>'A man who holds such opinions concerning
ladies is probably better qualified to
judge that other class which he has the
singular taste to mention in the same
sentence with them.'</p>

<p>'Perhaps. It is easier to find mercy for
victims than for tyrants.'</p>

<p>Edgar rose to his feet with the ponderous
dignity of an offended giant.</p>

<p>'If I had known your opinions on this
subject a little earlier, Mr. Maude, I should
never have allowed you to form an alliance
with my family.'</p>

<p>I rose too, as hot as he; and secretly
alarmed and repentant at the lengths to
which my recklessness had carried me, I was<span class="pagenum">[23]</span>
not ready to submit to the didactic rough-riding
of the man who had long ago himself
instilled into me his own supreme contempt
for the weaker sex.</p>

<p>'Perhaps I, Lord Edgar, should have
thought the honour too dearly bought if I
had known that it involved my acceptance of
a self-appointed keeper of my conscience.'</p>

<p>Our host, Sir Wilfrid Speke, now interfered
to calm the passions which were rapidly
getting the better of us, and thrusting my
gun under my arm, he literally carried me
off, and marching me to a covert on the
slope of a hill where was a noted 'warm
corner,' he told me good-humouredly to 'let
the birds have it,' and left me to myself and
them.</p>

<p>I was in a very bad temper. Enraged by
the recollection of Helen's simpering coldness,
by her brother's recently-assumed
dictatorship, and by my own reckless want of<span class="pagenum">[24]</span>
self-control a few minutes before, I was not
in the mood for sport. Was this to be the
result of my determination to take life more
seriously, that I discovered my <i>fianc&eacute;e</i> to be
a fool, my most honoured friend a bore, and
myself capable of undreamt-of depths of bad
taste and ill-temper? I would go back to
my old life of languid chatter and irresponsible
dissipation, I would content myself
again with my fame as the 'handsomest man
in town,' would accept my future wife for
what she was, and not for what she ought to
be, give her the inane, half-hearted attentions
which were so much more to her taste than
earnestness and devotion, and see thought
and Lord Edgar at the devil.</p>

<p>I felt much more inclined to shoot myself
than to open fire on the pheasants, but head-long
carelessness, and not tragic intention,
caused the accident which ensued. In getting
through a gap in a hedge, my gun was<span class="pagenum">[25]</span>
caught by a briar as I mounted to the higher
ground on the other side; I tried to free it,
and handling it incautiously, a sudden shock
to my face and right shoulder told me that I
had shot myself. I was blinded for the
moment, and trying to raise my right arm I
felt acute pain, and the next instant I felt the
warm blood trickling down my neck.</p>

<p>I tried to walk, but I staggered about and
could make no progress, so I leaned against
a tree and shouted; but my head growing
dizzy, I soon found myself on the ground,
filled with one wish&mdash;that I might live long
enough for some one to find me, and receive
the last instructions by which I could atone
to pretty Helen for the vulgar earnestness of
my love.</p>

<p>My next recollection is of a dull murmur
of voices heard, as it seemed, in the distance,
then of pain grown suddenly more acute
as I was moved; all the time I could see<span class="pagenum">[26]</span>
nothing, and I had only just time to understand
that I was being carried along by
friends whose voices I recognised, when I
fell again into unconsciousness.</p>

<p>I recovered to find myself back at Sir
Wilfrid's; a doctor was dressing my wounded
head and examining my shoulder; there was
a bandage across my eyes, and on trying to
speak I found that the right side of my face
was also bound up. I passed the night in
some pain, and must have been for part of it
light-headed, as I discovered two or three
days later, when Edgar, much moved, told
me that I had implored everybody who came
near me to witness that I left all I possessed
to Lady Helen Normanton, and had begged
for the pen and paper I could not have used,
to execute my proposed will.</p>

<p>During the next few days Edgar hardly
left my bedside. My head and eyes were
still kept tightly bandaged, so that I could<span class="pagenum">[27]</span>
neither see nor speak, nor take solid food.
Seeing me in this piteous condition, Edgar,
like the good fellow he was, decided that
sermons were out of season, and that I must
be amused. His humour, however, being of
a somewhat slow and cumbrous kind adapted
to his size, I took advantage of my enforced
silence to let him joke on unheeded, while
my own thoughts wandered dreamily away
to my life of the past few years, and to the
odd, quickly discovered mistake in which it
had lately culminated. I was surprised by
the persistency with which Helen's placid
silliness tormented me, fresh instances of it
coming every hour into my mind until I
began to ask myself whether the little blue-eyed
lady had really been born into the
world with a soul at all. And so, no longer
suffering bodily pain, I lay day after day,
very much absorbed by my own self-questionings,
and by strange dreams of a<span class="pagenum">[28]</span>
new Helen, who came to me with the fair
face and soft eyes of the old, but with bright
intelligence in her gaze, whispering with her
delicate lips words of love and tenderness.</p>

<p>I woke up suddenly one night, still hot
with my sleeping fancy that this revised
edition of my <i>fianc&eacute;e</i> had been with me. I
had seemed to feel her breath upon my
cheek, even to feel the touch of her lips upon
my ear, as she told me my illness had taught
her how much she loved me. I thought I
was answering her in passionate words with
a great thrill of joy in my heart, when I woke
up and found myself as usual in darkness and
silence.</p>

<p>'Edgar!' I called out; 'Edgar!'</p>

<p>He answered sleepily from a little way off,
'Yes. Do you want anything?'</p>

<p>'No, thank you.'</p>

<p>A pause.</p>

<p>'I say,' I went on a few moments later,<span class="pagenum">[29]</span>
'nobody has been in the room, have
they?'</p>

<p>'No, no-o-body,' with a yawn. 'At least,
I may have dozed, but I don't think&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'No, of course not.' But I was horribly
wide awake by this time. Some of the
bandages round my head having been removed
for the first time the evening before,
I had liberty of speech again, of which I
seemed resolved to make the most. 'I say,
Edgar, there's a fire flickering in the grate,
isn't there?'</p>

<p>'Yes, why?'</p>

<p>'Well, if I can see that quite well, why on
earth do they still keep the bandages over
my eyes? I know they were afraid of my
going blind. But I haven't; so what's it for?'</p>

<p>'I don't know,' mumbled Edgar, rather
blankly. He added hastily, 'I suppose the
doctor knows best; you'd better leave them
alone.'</p><p><span class="pagenum">[30]</span></p>

<p>'Oh yes.'</p>

<p>A long silence, during which Edgar,
under the impression that it was part of a
sick nurse's duty when the patient showed
signs of restlessness, pottered about the
room, and at last fell over something.</p>

<p>'I say, Edgar,' I began again, 'isn't my
face a good deal battered about on the right
side?'</p>

<p>I heard him stop, and there was a little
clash of glasses. Then he spoke, with some
constraint.</p>

<p>'Yes, a little. I daresay it will be some
time before it gets all right. But you've no
internal injuries or broken bones, and that's
the great thing.'</p>

<p>The last statement was made so effusively
that it was not difficult for me to gather that
my face was more deeply injured than he
liked to admit.</p>

<p>'I know quite well,' said I composedly,<span class="pagenum">[31]</span>
'that I shall have to swell the proud ranks
of the plain after this; I must cultivate my
intellect and my virtues, like the poor girls
whom we don't dance with! I've lost a
finger, too, haven't I? On my right hand?'</p>

<p>'Only two joints of it,' answered Edgar,
with laboured cheerfulness.</p>

<p>'What would poor Helen say to me if she
could see me now?' I suggested, rather
diffidently.</p>

<p>'Say! Why, what every true woman
would say, that she loved you ten times
better now you were disfigured than she did
when you were the counterpart of every
other good-looking popinjay in town!'</p>

<p>This, uttered with much ponderous vehemence,
was by no means reassuring to me.
In the first place, it confirmed the idea that
my injuries would leave permanent marks.
In the second place, it led me to ask myself
whether, Helen's chief merit in my eyes<span class="pagenum">[32]</span>
having been good looks, my chief merit in
her eyes might not have been the same.</p>

<p>As I said nothing, Edgar, now fully awake,
came nearer to the bed, and said solemnly:
'You do Helen injustice, Harry.'</p>

<p>'And you taught me to do her injustice,
Edgar.'</p>

<p>At first he said nothing to this, and I
knew that he understood me. But presently
I felt his hand laid emphatically on my left
shoulder, and he began in a low earnest voice:
'Look here, old chap, that's not quite fair.
I may have inveighed against the intellectual
inferiority of women scores of times when
you encouraged me by feeble protest. I may
have spoken of my own sister as an example
of the sweet and silly. When you saw her
and became infatuated about her I listened
to your rhapsodies in silence because I couldn't
endorse your opinion that she was an angel.
But I was glad you had taken a fancy to the<span class="pagenum">[33]</span>
child, and I knew that you might have done
much worse. Well, my opinions have undergone
no transformation. The women of the
middle class, whom it is now the fashion to
educate, the women of the lower class, who
have to work, may be considered as reasoning
creatures, varying, as men do, in their
reasoning powers. But the women of the
upper classes, <i>pur sang</i>, who are equally above
education and labour, may be ranked all together,
with the exception of those whom
alliance with the class below has regenerated,
as more or less fascinating idiots, whose minds
are cramped by unnatural and ignorant prejudices,
and in whom an occasional ray of
intelligence disperses itself in mere freaks of
art, of philanthropy, or of religion.'</p>

<p>'Then, if you are logical, you may end by
marrying a barmaid.'</p>

<p>'I think not. Barmaids are young women
who, by the exacting demands of their calling,<span class="pagenum">[34]</span>
are bound to be healthy, active, intelligent
and shrewd. Consider how such a woman
would be thrown away in the ridiculous and
empty existence led by our wives! How she
would laugh at the shallow interests of the
women around her, and despise her do-nothing
husband! Without counting that she
might be demoralised by her new position, and
add the mistakes of a parvenue to the foibles
of the class into which she was admitted!'</p>

<p>'Then, on the whole, you will&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Remain single, or take for wife the usual
fool of my own class, who will have the usual
fool of her own class for a husband.'</p>

<p>'But, Edgar,' said I, after a short pause,
'I am not so calm as you are, and my mind
is less well-regulated than yours. I want
something in my wife that you would not
want from yours. The docile acceptance of
my love would never content me; I want it
returned.'</p><p><span class="pagenum">[35]</span></p>

<p>But this view of the case had the effect of
irritating Edgar, who naturally resented the
idea of any other nature having deeper needs
than his own.</p>

<p>'It is unreasonable to expect, from our
physical and mental inferior, powers equal to
our own,' he said, in a tone of dismissal of
the subject.</p>

<p>'Then how am I to expect from Helen
the power of looking at my disfigured face
without horror, when I am by no means sure
that I could have felt redoubled devotion if a
similar accident had happened to her?'</p>

<p>'Women are different from us, and not to
be judged by the same rules. Beauty&mdash;of
some sort&mdash;is a duty with them, while every
one knows that an ugly man makes quicker
progress with them than a handsome one.'</p>

<p>'Well, I should like to judge what sort of
progress with them my ugliness is likely to
make. Give me a looking-glass.'</p><p><span class="pagenum">[36]</span></p>

<p>But he would not. He said the doctor
had forbidden me to use my eyes yet, that
my face was still unhealed, and the bandages
must not be moved. And finally he declined
to talk to me any longer, and told me to go
to sleep.</p>

<p>I was not satisfied. I knew that I was
getting well fast, that there was no need to
keep me in bed, and I felt curious as to the
reason of my still being kept so close a prisoner.
So I found an opportunity when I had
been left, as they thought, asleep, to remove
the bandage from my eyes with my left hand.
My sight seemed as good as ever, but the
skin round about my right eye seemed to
be tightly drawn. The window-blinds were
down, and as evening was coming on there
was only light enough to distinguish dimly
the objects in the room by the help of the
flickering flame of the fire. I got out of bed
and walked to the toilet-table, but the looking-glass<span class="pagenum">[37]</span>
had been taken away; to the mantelpiece,
with the same result. I grew impatient,
angry, and rather anxious. There was a
hand-glass in my dressing-bag, if I could only
find that; I remembered that I had left it in
the dressing-room. I dashed into the room,
and as that, too, was darkened, I turned to
draw up the blind. By that movement I
came face to face with a sight so appalling
that, of all the misfortunes my accident has
ever brought upon me, none, I think, has
given me a shock for the first moment so
horrible. I saw before me the figure of a
man with the face of a devil.</p>

<p>The right eyebrow, the right side of the
moustache were gone, and the hair as far as
the back of the right ear. The whole of this
side of the face, from forehead to chin, was a
puckered drawn mass of blackened shrivelled
skin, distorted into grotesque seams and furrows.
The right end of the eye and the right<span class="pagenum">[38]</span>
corner of the mouth were drawn up, giving to
the whole face a sinister and evil expression.</p>

<p>After a few moments' contemplation of
my new self, I turned away from the glass,
feeling sick with disgust and horror. In the
first shock of my discovery, no reflection that
I was looking upon the fearful sight at its
worst, and that the healing work was still
going on underneath the scarred and desiccated
skin, came to console me.</p>

<p>My back turned upon my own image, my
stupefaction gave place to rapid thought. I
saw in a moment that the old course of my
life was at one blow broken up, that I must
begin again as if I had been born that day.
I must go away, not only from my own
friends, but from the chance of coming in contact
with them again. I must leave England.
Also, since if I were to make my resolution
known I should be inundated with kindly
meant dissuasions, I must breathe no hint of<span class="pagenum">[39]</span>
my intention until I was quite able to carry
it into execution. I was sure that no one but
the doctor, and perhaps Edgar, had seen my
face in its present condition, and that no description
could give to others any idea of its
appearance. I felt that my bodily health and
strength were all that they had ever been,
and that nothing but the wish to keep the
knowledge of my disfigurement from me as
long as possible had prompted the doctor's
orders to me to remain in bed and to retain
the bandages. It now, too, occurred to me
that delay might bring some slight modification
of my hideousness, and I resolved to
let nature do what little she could, and not to
set out on my travels until the mask which
now covered one-half my face had fallen off,
and disclosed whatever fresh horrors might
be underneath. Then I would, without letting
any one see my face, start for some German
Spa for the benefit of my health; before<span class="pagenum">[40]</span>
I had been away three months I should be
forgotten, and free to wend my way wherever
I pleased. This idea, to a man to whom life
had begun to present something like a deadlock,
was not without charm. Society was a
bore, love a delusion; now was the chance to
find out what else there was worth learning
in life.</p>

<p>I heard Edgar's voice in the distance, and
had only time to rush back to bed, put on
the bandages round my face, and turn on my
side as if asleep, before he came into the
room.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</h2>

<p>As I heard Edgar creaking softly about the
room, giving the impression, even as I lay
with my eyes shut, unable to observe his
elaborate movements, of great weight trying
to be light, my heart smote me at the thought
of deceiving him with the rest. 'The elephant,'
it had been a joke between ourselves
for me to call him; and like a great elephant
he was, huge, intelligent, gentle, not without
a certain massive beauty, with keen feelings
of loyalty, and a long slow-smouldering
memory, with inclinations towards a laborious
and somewhat painful sportiveness.
Rebel against his sententious homilies as I<span class="pagenum">[42]</span>
occasionally might, he was a good old fellow,
and I was fond of him. I moved a little to
show him I was awake, and then said:</p>

<p>'Hallo, Edgar, is that you?'</p>

<p>'Yes. How do you feel?'</p>

<p>'Oh, ever so much better. I shall be getting
up soon now.'</p>

<p>'Well, you mustn't be in too great a hurry.
You have been patient so long, it would
be a pity to destroy your credit just at the
last.'</p>

<p>'I am only waiting for my face to heal
now, of course. But, I say, Edgar, it will
take a long time for that to get all right.
Why, part of my cheek was completely blown
away. It will be months, at least, before I
dare show myself. I think I shall go to some
German baths, and, you know, I don't know
how long I may have to stay there. In the
meantime&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'In the meantime, what?'</p><p><span class="pagenum">[43]</span></p>

<p>'Your sister&mdash;Helen&mdash;must know that she
is free.'</p>

<p>'But supposing she doesn't want to be
free? Supposing&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Supposing she has a fancy for being tied
to a death's-head? No, Edgar, she must be
released at once. I want you to write a
letter from me to her, if you will. The
sooner it is over the better for both of us.'</p>

<p>I suppose Edgar felt that my attitude
was not one of pure resignation, for he made
no further effort to dissuade me, but went
instantly in search of pens and paper. He
was so very submissive, however, in taking
this step, which I knew to be distasteful to
him, that I was quite sure, before the letter
was half written, that he was 'up to' something.
So, when it was finished, I was
mean enough to insist on his leaving it with
me, together with the directed envelope;
and after reading it carefully through myself<span class="pagenum">[44]</span>
as soon as I was alone, I made the housekeeper
fold it and seal it up in my presence,
and directed her to get it posted at once.</p>

<p>The letter said:</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">My Dearest Helen</span>&mdash;You have no doubt
long ago heard the reason of my silence, and forgiven
me for it, I am sure. I am sorry to tell
you that my head [I felt an odd shyness of
saying "my face"] has been injured so seriously
that it will be a long time before I can return to
town; I am going straight to Germany as soon
as I am able to leave here, and cannot yet tell
when I shall be in England again. Under these
circumstances, although I know that you would
overlook my new imperfections with the same
sweetness with which you have forgiven my older
defects, I feel that I cannot impose again upon
your generosity. I therefore set you free, begging
you to do me one last kindness by not returning
to me the little souvenirs that you have from time
to time been good enough to accept from me.
And please don't send me back my letters, if you
have ever received them with any pleasure.
Burn them if you like. I will send back yours if<span class="pagenum">[45]</span>
you wish; but, as no woman will ever look with
love upon my face again, your womanly dignity
will suffer but little if you let me still keep them.
There are only eight of them. And there is a
glove, of course, and a packet of dried flowers, of
course, and the little silver match-box. All these
I shall insist upon keeping, whether you like it or
not. They could not compromise anybody; the
little glove could pass for a child's. You will
trust me with them all, will you not? You see
this isn't the usual broken-off match with its
prelude of disastrous squabbles and wrangles.
Some jealous demon who saw I did not deserve
my good fortune has broken my hopes of happiness
abruptly, and released you from a chain
which I am afraid my ill-temper had already
begun to make irksome to you. Forgive me
now, and bear as kindly a recollection of me as
you can. God bless you, Helen. I shall always
treasure the remembrance of your little fairy face,
and remember gratefully your sweet forbearance
with me.&mdash;Yours most sincerely and affectionately,</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">Henry Lyttleton Maude</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p>I hoped the child would not think this<span class="pagenum">[46]</span>
letter too cold and formal. My heart
yearned towards her now with a longing
more tender than before; I felt oppressed
by the necessity of foregoing the shallow
little love which, as the handsomest man
about town, I had begun to consider far
beneath my deserts.</p>

<p>Two days later I received an answer from
Helen. I waited until I was alone to read
it, for I still guarded my face carefully from
all eyes but the doctor's. The touch of the
letter, the sight of the sprawling, slap-dash
handwriting which it delighted Helen to
assume, in common with the other young
ladies of her generation, moved me; for I
could not but feel that this was the last
'<i>billet</i>' by any possibility to be called '<i>doux</i>'
which I should ever receive. I opened it
with an apprehension that I should find the
contents less moving than the envelope.
I was mistaken.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[47]</span></p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">My Dearest Harry</span>&mdash;I am afraid you have
a very poor opinion of me if you think I care for
nothing but personal attractions. You have
always been most kind and generous to me, and
you need not think because I am not intellectual
myself I do not care for a man who is intellectual
and all those things. I am coming down to see
you myself and then if you wish to give me up
you can do so&mdash;but I hope you will not throw me
over so hastily. I am so sorry for your accident
and that it has made you so ill, but I do not
mind what else it has done.&mdash;Believe me, dearest
Harry, with best love, hoping you will soon be
quite recovered, yours ever lovingly,</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">Helen</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p>Childish as the letter was it touched me
deeply. Edgar must be right after all;
I had misjudged a simple but loyal nature
that only wanted an emergency to bring its
nobler qualities to the surface. I told him
about the letter, and added that it made
giving her up harder to bear.</p>

<p>'Why should you give her up?' said he<span class="pagenum">[48]</span>
eagerly. 'You see she herself will not hear
of it.'</p>

<p>'Because she does not understand the
case. I am disfigured past recognition; she
would shrink with horror from the sight of
me. It would be a shock even to you, a
strong unromantic man, to see what I have
become.'</p>

<p>'You are too sensitive, old fellow. However
shocking the change in you may be,
you cannot fail to exaggerate its effect on
others.'</p>

<p>'We shall see.'</p>

<p>A few days later, when the horror of my
new appearance was indeed a little mitigated
by the falling off of the withered outer skin
which had covered the right side of my face,
I tried the effect of my striking physiognomy
on Edgar.</p>

<p>Whether he had expected some such
surprise, or whether he was endowed with<span class="pagenum">[49]</span>
a splendid insensibility to ugliness, he stood
the shock with the most stolid placidity.</p>

<p>'Well?' said I defiantly, looking at him
from out my ill-matched eyes in a passion of
aggressive rage.</p>

<p>'Well?' said he, as complacently as if
I had been a turnip.</p>

<p>'I hope you admire this style of beauty,'
I hurled out savagely.</p>

<p>'I don't go quite so far as that, but it's
really much better than I expected.'</p>

<p>'You are easily pleased.'</p>

<p>He went on quietly. 'The chief impression
your countenance gives one now is
not, as you flatter yourself, of consummate
ugliness, but&mdash;forgive me&mdash;of consummate
villainy.'</p>

<p>'What!'</p>

<p>'You are preserved for ever from the
danger of being anything but strictly virtuous
and straightforward in your dealings,<span class="pagenum">[50]</span>
for no one would trust the possessor of
that countenance with either a secret or a
sovereign.'</p>

<p>This blunt frankness acted better than
any softer measures could have done; it
made me laugh. Looking again at myself
in a glass, for I was now up and dressed,
I noticed, what had escaped me before in my
paralysed contemplation of the change in my
own features, that the drawing up of the
right-hand corners of my mouth and eye,
together with the removal of every vestige
of hair from that side of the face, had given
me the grotesquely repulsive leer of a satyr.
To crown my disadvantages, the left side
of my face, seen in profile, still retained its
natural appearance to mock my new hideousness.</p>

<p>'But I think I see a way out of all difficulties,'
Edgar went on, more seriously.
'You will advance objections, I know, but<span class="pagenum">[51]</span>
you must permit your objections to be overruled.
Accident can be combated by artifice,
and to artifice you must resort until nature
does her work and relieves you from the new
necessity.'</p>

<p>We fought out the question, and at last
I very unwillingly gave way, and submitted
to the adoption of a false eyebrow, a false
moustache, and a beautiful tuft of curly false
hair much superior to my own, to hide the
bald patch left by the accident.</p>

<p>Rather elated by this distinct improvement,
assumed for the reception of Helen's
promised visit, and encouraged by assurances
that my own hair would soon grow
again and enable me to discard its substitutes,
I was ready to believe that the
discoloration and disfigurement still visible
were comparatively unimportant, and that
the repellent expression, which no artifice
much abated, might indeed affect strangers,<span class="pagenum">[52]</span>
but would not, in the sight of my friends,
obscure their long-established impression of
my amiability and sweetness.</p>

<p>Sir Wilfrid and Lady Speke had by this
time gone up to town, leaving the place,
with many kind wishes for my early and
complete recovery, entirely at the disposal of
myself and my unwearied nurse Edgar. So
a day was fixed for the arrival of Helen and
her mother. On that eventful afternoon
Edgar settled me in a small sitting-room on
the same floor with the room I had been
occupying, before starting for the station.
The blinds were drawn, and I sat with
my back to this carefully-softened light. I
wished, now that the ordeal was getting so
near, that I had not let myself be dissuaded
from my intention of sneaking quietly away
without showing my disfigured face to any
one. What was the use of my seeing the
child again? I did indeed long foolishly for<span class="pagenum">[53]</span>
a few last words with her since she had
shown unexpected depth of feeling towards
me in my misfortune; but it could not end,
as Edgar still obstinately hoped, in a renewal
of our engagement, which I persisted in
regarding as definitely broken. The meeting
was only for a farewell. I was ashamed
of the artifices I had used to conceal the
traces of my accident, and I was feeling half
inclined to tear off my false ornaments and
present myself in my true hideousness, when
the arrival of my visitors luckily stopped me.
The room where I sat was at the back of
the house, so that I had no warning of the
return of the carriage until I heard Edgar's
voice. I sprang up with one last look of
agony at my reflection in the glass, which
seemed to me at that moment a ghastly
caricature of my old self, and then sat nervously
down again, feeling like a doomed
wretch with the executioner outside his cell.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[54]</span></p>

<p>The door opened, and Edgar bounded up
to me, dragging Helen, who seemed shy and
nervous, forward on his arm.</p>

<p>'Here he is, Nellie. Getting well fast,
you see. Where is mother? I must fetch
her up.'</p>

<p>I saw in a moment through the dear clumsy
fellow's man&oelig;uvres. He prided himself on
his strategy, fancying he had only to leave us
together for us to have a touching reconciliation.
But I knew better. I saw her turn
pale and cling to her brother's arm, and I
said hastily&mdash;</p>

<p>'No, no. Lady Castleford is not far behind,
you may be sure. I am glad to see you,
Lady Helen; it is very kind of you to come.
It is easier&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Helen has come to persuade you to get
well in England among your friends instead
of going abroad to be ill among strangers,'
said Edgar, cutting me short. 'He's getting<span class="pagenum">[55]</span>
on well, isn't he, Helen? Come, he's well
enough to have his hand shaken now.'</p>

<p>He drew her forward, to my inexpressible
pain, for I saw the reluctance in her face.
Before I could attempt a protest, a reassuring
word, she had held out her hand, which I
timidly took. Then she lifted her eyes to
my face for the first time. For the first and
last time I saw the expression of the most
vivid, most acute emotion on the fairy face.
The muscles were contracted, the pupils of
the eyes were dilated with intense horror.</p>

<p>'I am very glad&mdash;&mdash;' she began.</p>

<p>Then, before she could finish her sentence,
even while I still held her little hand in mine,
she fell like a crushed flower unconscious in
her brother's arms.</p>

<p>Poor fellow! How contrite, how miserably,
abjectly humble and despairing he was
when he appeared later in my room, to which
I had fled, like a wounded beast to its den,<span class="pagenum">[56]</span>
when little Helen's unwilling blow gave me
my social death-warrant. I was able to laugh
then, and to tell him truly that my only regret
was for the pain the injudicious meeting had
caused poor Helen.</p>

<p>'It was you who dictated her letter to me,'
I said.</p>

<p>Edgar did not attempt to deny it.</p>

<p>'She ought to be ashamed of herself,' said
he, reddening with indignation.</p>

<p>'No, we ought to be ashamed of ourselves.
I for my vanity in thinking there was any
charm in my dull personality to compensate
for the loss of the only merit I could have in
a girl's eyes; you for your generous idiotcy in
carrying that mistake farther still. Are they
gone?'</p>

<p>'Yes. My mother wanted to see you,
but&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'That's all right. And now, old fellow,
you mustn't make any more blunders on my<span class="pagenum">[57]</span>
account; you must let me make my own. I
leave England in a few days.'</p>

<p>'Well, I suppose you must do as you like.
I'll come and see you off.'</p>

<p>'No,' said I firmly. 'I shall say good-bye
to you here, Edgar. I have very particular
reasons for it, and you must give way
to me in this.'</p>

<p>He tried to change my mind; he wanted
to know my reasons; but he was unsuccessful
in both attempts. I knew how obstinate he
was, and that if I once allowed him to go with
me to town, he would be sure to subject me
to more painful meetings in the endeavour to
persuade me to remain in England. Luckily
for me, the very next day the Marquis telegraphed
to his son to join him immediately
in Monmouthshire; and no sooner had Edgar
left the house, with the sure knowledge that
he should not see me again, than I fulfilled
his fears by instant preparation for my own<span class="pagenum">[58]</span>
departure. I had discarded all disguises, and
contented myself by masking my face as much
as possible with a travelling cap and a muffler;
on arriving in town I went to an hotel in
Covent Garden, where I was not known, and
by the evening of the following day I had
provided myself with the outfit of a Transpontine
villain, a low-crowned, wide-brimmed soft
hat and a black Spanish cloak.</p>

<p>In this get-up, which, when not made too
conspicuous by a stage-walk and melodramatic
glances around, is really a very efficient disguise
both of form and features, I knew myself
to be quite safe from recognition anywhere,
and having decided to start from Charing
Cross for Cologne by way of Ostend on the
following morning, I devoted the evening of
my second day in town to a last look round.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p>It was Saturday evening; a week of fog
having been succeeded by a week of rain, the
pavements were now well coated with black
slimy mud, in which one kept one's footing
as best one could, stimulated by plentiful
showers of the same substance, in a still more
fluid state, flung by the wheels of passing
vehicles.</p>

<p>Oh, wisely-governed city, where there is
work for thousands of starving men, while
thousands of men are starving for want of
work! If a boy can keep a crossing clean in
a crowded thoroughfare, could not an organised
gang of men, ten times as numerous and<span class="pagenum">[60]</span>
twice as active as our gentle scavengers, save
the sacred boots, skirts, and trousers of the
respectable classes from that brush-resisting
abomination, London mud? I respectfully
recommend this suggestion to my betters
with the assurance that, if it is considered of
any value, there are plenty more where that
came from.</p>

<p>Starting from Covent Garden, I made my
way through King Street, Garrick Street,
Cranbourne Street, Leicester Square and
Coventry Street, into Regent Street, and was
struck by a hundred common London sights
and incidents which, in the old days, when
my own life was so idle and yet so absorbing,
had entirely escaped my notice. Oxford
Street, Bond Street, Piccadilly, St. James's
Street, I made the tour of them all; past the
clubs, of many of which I was a member,
brushing, unrecognised, by a dozen men who
had known me well, into Trafalgar Square,<span class="pagenum">[61]</span>
where the gas-lamps cast long glittering lines
of light on the wet pavement, and the spire
of St. Martin's and the dome of the National
Gallery rose like gray shadow-palaces above
in the rainy air.</p>

<p>I dined at a restaurant in the Strand, and
then, growing confident in the security of my
disguise, I thought I would take a farewell
glance at an old chum who had run Edgar
pretty close in my esteem. He was an actor,
and was fulfilling an engagement at a theatre
in the Strand. When I add that he played
what are technically called 'juvenile' parts&mdash;that
is to say, those of the stage lovers&mdash;my
taste may seem strange, until I explain
that Fabian Scott was the very worst of all
the fashionable 'juveniles,' being addicted to
literary and artistic pursuits and other intellectual
exercises which, while permissible and
innocuous to what are called 'character'
actors, are ruin to 'juveniles,' whose business<span class="pagenum">[62]</span>
requires vigour rather than thought, picturesqueness
rather than feeling. So that
Fabian, with his thin keen face, his intensity,
and some remnant of North-country stiffness,
stood only in the second rank of those whom
the ladies delighted to worship; and becoming
neither a great artist nor a great popinjay,
gave his friends a sense of not having done
quite the best with himself, but was a very
interesting, if somewhat excitable companion.
For my own part I had then, not knowing
how vitally important the question of his
character would one day become to me,
nothing to wish for in him save that he were
a little less sour and a little more sincere.</p>

<p>The stage-door was up a narrow and dirty
court leading from the Strand. At the opening
of the court stood a stout fair man, who
looked like a German, and whose coarse,
swollen face and dull eyes bore witness to
a life of low dissipation. He was respectably<span class="pagenum">[63]</span>
but not well dressed, and he swung the cheap
and showy walking-stick in his hand slowly
backwards and forwards, in a stolidly swaggering
and aggressive manner. I should not
have noticed him so particularly, but for the
fact that he filled the narrow entrance to the
passage so completely that I had to ask him
to let me pass. Instead of immediately complying,
he looked at me from my feet to my
head with surly, half-tipsy insolence, and gave
a short thick laugh.</p>

<p>'Oh, so you're one of the swells, I suppose,
who come hanging round stage-doors
to tempt hard-working respectable women
away from their lawful husbands! But it
won't do. I tell you it won't do!'</p>

<p>I pushed him aside with one vigorous
thrust and went up the court, followed by the
outraged gentleman, who made no attempt
to molest me except by a torrent of abusive
eloquence, from which I gathered that he<span class="pagenum">[64]</span>
was the husband of one of the actresses at
the theatre, and that she did not appreciate
the virtues of her lord and master as he considered
she ought, but that, nevertheless, he
persisted in affording her the protection of
his manly arm, and would do so in spite of
all the d&mdash;&mdash;d 'mashers' in London.</p>

<p>At this point the stage-doorkeeper came
out of his little box, and informed the angry
gentleman that if he went on disgracing the
place by his scandalous conduct his wife's
services would be dispensed with; 'and if
there's no money for her to earn, there'll be
no beer for you to drink, Mr. Ellmer,' continued
the little old man, with more point
than politeness.</p>

<p>The threat had instant effect. Mr. Ellmer
subsided into indignant mumbling, and went
down the court again.</p>

<p>I had forgotten myself in interest at the
rout of Mr. Ellmer, to whom I had taken a<span class="pagenum">[65]</span>
rabid dislike, and was standing in the full, if
feeble light of the gas over the stage-door,
when an inner door was thrust open, and the
next moment Fabian Scott was shaking my
hand heartily.</p>

<p>'Hallo, Harry! I am glad to see you
again. I was afraid you were going away
without a word to your old friends; but you
were always better than your reputation. Got
over your accident all right&mdash;eh?'</p>

<p>'As well as could be expected, I suppose.
I start for Germany to-morrow.'</p>

<p>'Ah!' By this one exclamation he signified
that he understood the case, and knew
that my mind was definitely made up. Actors
are men of the world, and I felt the relief of
talking to him after the stolid and obstinate
misapprehension with which dear old Edgar
persisted in meeting my reasons for saying
good-bye to society. 'It was good of you
not to go without coming here,' he went on,<span class="pagenum">[66]</span>
appreciating the fact that my visit must have
entailed an effort.</p>

<p>'To tell the truth, I meant to see you
without your seeing me; but I got interested
in a moral victory just obtained by your doorkeeper
over an eloquent visitor, and so you
caught me.'</p>

<p>Scott glanced at the swaggering Ellmer.</p>

<p>'Drunken brute!' said he, with much
disgust. 'His wife&mdash;a hard-working little
woman, who acts under the name of Miss
Bailey&mdash;has had to bring her child to the
theatre with her to-night, for fear he should
get home before her and frighten the poor
little thing. Look! here they come. One
wonders how a wild beast can be the father
of an angel.'</p>

<p>Scott was an ardent worshipper of beauty;
but I, a cooler mortal, could not think his
raptures excessive when he stood aside to
make way for a slim, pale, pretty woman, to<span class="pagenum">[67]</span>
whose hand there clung a child so beautiful
that my whole heart revolted at the thought
that the tipsy ruffian a few paces off was her
father. Both mother and child were shabbily
dressed, in clothes which gave one the idea
that November had overtaken them before
they could afford to replace the garments of
July. The little one was about eight years
old, a slender creature with a flower-like face,
round which, from under a home-made red
velvet cap, her light-brown hair fell in a
naturally curly tangle. Something in her
blue eyes reminded me of the childlike charm
of Helen's. Scott stopped them to say
good-night, effusively addressing the child as
his little sweetheart, and telling her that if
the boy who gave her an apple last Sunday
gave her another the next day, he should
find out where he lived and murder that
boy.</p>

<p>'Beware, Babiole, of arousing the jealousy<span class="pagenum">[68]</span>
of a desperate man,' he ended, folding his
arms and tossing back his head.</p>

<p>The child took his outburst quite seriously.</p>

<p>'If he offers me another apple I must take
it,' she answered in a sweet demure little
voice. 'It would be rude to refuse. But
you needn't be angry, for I can like you too.'</p>

<p>'Like me <i>too</i>!' thundered Scott, with
melodramatic gestures. 'Heaven and earth!
This is how the girl dares to trifle with the
fiercest passion that ever surged in a human
breast!'</p>

<p>'If you're fierce I shan't like you,' said the
little one, in her measured way. 'Papa's
fierce, and he frightens me and mamma.'</p>

<p>'Will you like me, little madam?' I ventured;
and, knowing that my disfigured face
was well concealed, I held out my hand. 'I
will love you very gently.'</p>

<p>I made my voice as soft as I could, but
the deep tones or the sombre black figure<span class="pagenum">[69]</span>
frightened her. The quaint matronly demeanour
suddenly gave way to a child's
fright, and she hid her face in the folds
of her mother's black cloth jacket. Then
mamma began to rebuke in a voice and
manner oddly like the child's; and Fabian
seized Babiole and lifted her up to kiss
her.</p>

<p>'And now will you give me a kiss?' said
he to her.</p>

<p>'Yes, Mr. Scott.' She gave him a kiss
with the same demure simplicity.</p>

<p>'And will you promise to kiss nobody but
me till you see me again?'</p>

<p>'Really, Mr. Scott,' interrupted the mother
rather tartly, 'you shouldn't put such ideas
into the child's head. They'll come quite
soon enough of their own accord.'</p>

<p>She had one eye upon her husband, who
was waiting farther down the court; and the
wifely desire to be 'at him' seemed to put a<span class="pagenum">[70]</span>
little extra vinegar into her tone. With a
hasty good-night to Fabian, and a frosty
little bow to the unknown black figure, she
said, 'Come, Babiole,' and hurried away
with the child.</p>

<p>Scott put his arm through mine, and we
followed them slowly back into the Strand,
where, amidst the throng of people who had
just poured out of the theatres, we soon lost
sight of them. We did not go far together,
for Fabian had an appointment to supper;
but before we parted, he, more ready-witted
than Edgar, had talked me into a promise
that, when the summer came round and he
had a chance of a holiday, I would let him
know where I was, that he might invite
himself to come and see me.</p>

<p>'You don't think I shall come back among
you again, then?' I said curiously.</p>

<p>'I don't know. The taste for wandering,
like all other tastes, grows with indulgence.<span class="pagenum">[71]</span>
Good-bye, Harry, and God bless you whereever
you go.'</p>

<p>I wrung his hand, scarcely able to speak.
His words were a prophecy, I knew; and at
the moment of taking this last outsider's look
at the scenes of my old life, it seemed to me
that a dungeon-door had swung to on youth
and hope and happiness, shutting me in for
ever to a very lonely solitude.</p>

<p>'Good-bye, good-bye, Fabian,' said I, and
I walked hastily away lest I should keep on
wringing his hand all night.</p>

<p>For three hours more I walked about the
London streets, unable to tear myself away
from them, sneaking again past the clubs,
with a feeling of gushing affection towards a
score of idiotic young men and prosy old
ones who passed me on the pavement on their
way in or out, devoured by a longing to exchange
if only half a dozen words with men
whom I had often avoided as bores. Near<span class="pagenum">[72]</span>
the steps of the Carlton I did try to address
one quiet old gentleman whom, on account of
his rapacity for papers, I had cordially hated.
A ridiculous shyness made me hoarse; and
on hearing a husky voice close to his ears in
almost apologetic tones, he started violently,
cried, 'Eh, what? No, no! Here&mdash;hansom!'
and I retreated like one of the
damned.</p>

<p>I got into Grosvenor Square, passed
through a throng of carriages, and saw the
bright lights in a house where they were
giving a birthday dance to which I had been
specially invited months before. Helen
would be there, I knew; I felt a jealous
satisfaction in remembering that old Saxmundham
was away, nursing his gout at
Torquay. What of that? There were
plenty of other men to step into my shoes.
At first I thought I would stay, and walk up
and down the square for the chance of one<span class="pagenum">[73]</span>
more look at her. How well I knew how
she would come down the steps, in a timid
hesitating way, half-dazzled by the lights she
had just left, poising each little dainty foot a
moment above the next step, flit into the
carriage like a soft white bird, and drop her
pretty head back with a sigh, 'Oh, I'm so
tired, mamma!' her white throat curved
gently above the swansdown of her cloak,
the golden fringe of curls falling limply
almost to her eyebrows. I must wait&mdash;I
must see her again! What! On the arm
of another man! The blood rushed into
my head as these incoherent thoughts rose
rapidly in my mind; all the passions of my
life, of my youth, dammed up as they had
suddenly been by my accident and its fatal
consequences, seemed to surge up, break
through the barriers of resignation and resolve,
and make a madman of me. I was
not master of myself, I could not count upon<span class="pagenum">[74]</span>
what I should do if I saw her; seeing my
way no more than if I had been blind or
intoxicated, I turned away, and finding
myself presently in silent Bond Street, I
got into a hansom and went back to my
hotel.</p>

<p>I fancied that night that sooner or later I
should end by suicide; but in the morning I
had to pack, to buy things for my journey,
and to set out on my travels. The worst
wrench was over; before I had left England
a week, I was almost a philosopher.</p>

<p>For five years I lived a wanderer's life,
and found it fairly to my liking. I hunted
the boar in Germany, the wolf in France,
went salmon-fishing in Norway, shot two
tigers in India; got as far as California in
search of adventures, of which I had plenty;
passed a fortnight with Red Indians, whom
on the whole I prefer in pictures; and began
to acquire a distaste for civilisation, mitigated<span class="pagenum">[75]</span>
by enjoyment of meetings once a year with
Edgar and Fabian Scott.</p>

<p>I retained the lease of a shooting-box and
of a few miles of deer-forest by the Deeside,
between Ballater and picturesque little Loch
Muick. Larkhall, as the house was called,
became, therefore, our yearly rendezvous.
On our second meeting, the party was increased
by a new member, Mr. William
Fussell, a gentleman who was 'something in
the City.' I never could quite make out what
that something was, but it must have been
some exceedingly pleasant and lucrative profession,
since Mr. Fussell, while constantly
describing himself as one of the unlucky ones,
was always in spirits high, not to say rollicking,
and was gifted with powers of enjoyment
which could only be the result of long and
assiduous practice. I had met him at a
German hotel, where I had been struck by
the magnificent insolence of his assertion that<span class="pagenum">[76]</span>
he had acquired a thorough command of the
German language in three weeks, and by the
astonishing measure of success which attended
his daring plunges into that tongue.
He was serenely jolly, selfish, and sociable,
pathetically complaining of his wife's conduct
in letting him come away for his holiday by
himself, and enjoying himself very much
without her. He was so envious of my good
fortune when I said that I was going boar-hunting,
that I invited him to accompany
me; and as he showed much pluck in a
rather nasty encounter we had with an infuriated
boar, and much frankness in owning
afterwards that he was frightened, I forthwith
invited him to Scotland, and he accepted the
invitation, as he did all good things which
came in his way, with avidity.</p>

<p>At the third of our yearly meetings a fifth
and last member joined us. This was a
clever young Irishman, of good family, small<span class="pagenum">[77]</span>
fortune, sickly body, and still sicklier mind,
to whom accident had put me under a small
obligation, which I was glad to repay by
enabling him to visit the Highlands, to which
his doctor had prescribed a visit. He had
been making an exhaustive and strictly philosophical
inquiry into the iniquities of Paris,
in the corruption of which he appeared to
revel; indeed, he was clever enough to find
so much depravity in every spot he had
visited, that I wondered what repulsive view
he would be able to take of our sweet-scented
fir-forests, and the long miles of the rippling
winding Dee; or whether, in the absence of
labyrinthine mazes of dirt and disease, vice
and crime to explore and minutely expose, he
would pine and die.</p>

<p>Except these two, I had, during those five
years of wandering, made no new friend.
My appalling ugliness, mitigated as it was
by time, had, together with the reserve it<span class="pagenum">[78]</span>
taught me, to a great degree isolated me.
But perfect independence has its pleasures,
and I was not an unhappy man. Until the
end of the fourth year I had not even a
servant, and I avoided all women; at that
point, however, I yielded to the fatal human
weakness of attaching to one's self some fellow-creature,
and engaged as my personal attendant
a cosmopolitan individual, whose
qualifications for the post consisted in the
fact that he had been a lawyer's clerk in
England, a cow-boy in Mexico, had had
charge of a lunatic at Naples, and was a
deserter from the Austrian army. Plain to
begin with, deeply marked with smallpox,
and disfigured by a sabre-cut across the nose,
he was even uglier than I, a fact which
seemed, from the frequency with which he
alluded to it, to gratify him as much as it did
me. His name was John Ferguson, but it
did not occur to me to connect his name with<span class="pagenum">[79]</span>
his origin until the time came to prepare for
my fifth annual visit to Scotland.</p>

<p>'I should have thought one plain countenance
about you was enough, sir, without
your wanting to see them at every turn,' he
said ill-temperedly, when told to pack up.</p>

<p>'I suppose you come from Auld Reekie
yourself, then, since you're so reluctant to go
back to it?'</p>

<p>'Well, sir, and where's the harm of being
born there, provided you get away from it as
early as you can, and never go back to it till
you can help!'</p>

<p>'Why, Ferguson, that's spoken like a true
patriot.'</p>

<p>'Indeed, sir, I hope I am wise enough not
to hold a place the better for having produced
such a poor creature as myself,' said
John, who could always give a good account
of himself in an argument.</p>

<p>But once established at Larkhall, Ferguson<span class="pagenum">[80]</span>
found himself so comfortable that, at the
end of the fortnight's visit of my friends, he
again made objection to packing up, which
I was in the mood to listen to indulgently.</p>

<p>'It seems a pity like to leave the place till
the shooting season's over, don't it, sir?' he
hazarded one morning.</p>

<p>'Yes, Ferguson, perhaps it does.'</p>

<p>'The Continent wouldn't run away if it was
left to look after itself a few weeks longer,
would it, sir?' he went on.</p>

<p>'No, Ferguson, perhaps it wouldn't,'
said I.</p>

<p>'Shall I leave the packing till to-morrow,
sir?' he then asked.</p>

<p>'Well, yes, I think you may.'</p>

<p>From which it is clear that Ferguson had
already been shrewd enough to assume a
proper authority over his nominal master.</p>

<p>I had become a little weary of wandering,
and although I by no means intended to give<span class="pagenum">[81]</span>
up the nomadic life which I had led for five
years, I thought a couple of months' rest
would be a pleasant change; I could be on
the move before the cold weather set in.
But September passed, and October and
November came, and it grew very bleak;
and still I stayed on, finding a new pleasure
in the changed aspect of the gaunt hills, in
seeing the snow patches grow larger and
larger on Lochnagar, in outstaying the last
of the late visitors, and in finding a spot
where solitude needed no seeking.</p>

<p>The railway runs from Aberdeen to Ballater.
One morning, arriving at the little
station for my papers, I found a train just
starting, and was seized by an impulse to pay
a short visit to the granite city. A feeling
left by my wandering life made it always
difficult for me to see a train or a boat
start without me. So I sent a boy to Larkhall
with a message to Ferguson, who, with<span class="pagenum">[82]</span>
a lad under him, constituted my entire household,
took my ticket and started. It was
past five when I reached Aberdeen; after a
sharp walk to the brig o' Balgownie and
back, I hired a private room at an hotel, and
dined by myself. Making inquiries about
the theatre, I learnt that the entertainment
that week was very poor, and further that it
had been so badly patronised that it was
doubtful whether the unfortunate players
would get their meagre salaries. I was
glancing at the yellow bill which advertised
<i>Rob Roy</i> as a Saturday night attraction,
when I read the names of Miss Bailey and
Miss Babiole Bailey.</p>

<p>I got up at once and walked quickly down
to the little theatre.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</h2>

<p>I remember very little of the performance
that night, except the painful impression produced
upon me by the sight of the effort
with which a tall spectre-like woman, with
sunken hollow face and feeble voice, in whom
I with difficulty recognised pretty Mrs.
Ellmer, dragged herself through the part of
Diana Vernon. Babiole I utterly failed to
distinguish. Looking out as I did for my
little eight-year old fairy, with gold-brown
hair curling naturally in large loose rings
over her blue eyes, I could not be expected
to know that an awkward sparrow-legged
minion of the king, wearing high boots, a<span class="pagenum">[84]</span>
tabard, and a parson's wideawake pinned up
and ornamented with a long white feather,
was what five years and a limited stage wardrobe
had made of the lovely child.</p>

<p>I waited for them at the stage door a
long time after the performance was over,
saw the rest of the little company come out
in twos and threes, one or two depressed and
silent, but most of them loudly cursing their
manager, the Scotch nation in general, and
the people of Aberdeen in particular. Then
the manager himself came out with his wife,
a buxom lady who had played Helen Macgregor
with a good deal of spirit, but who
seemed, from the stoical forbearance with
which she received the outpourings of her
husband's wrath at his ill-luck, to be a disappointingly
mild and meek person in private
life. 'But what will they do, Bob? I
believe the mother's dying,' I heard her
protest gently. 'Can't help that. We must<span class="pagenum">[85]</span>
look out for ourselves. And Marie will
make a better juvenile at half Miss Bailey's
screw,' said her husband gruffly. Last of all
came Mrs. Ellmer, thinner and shabbier
than ever, leaning on the arm of an overgrown
girl a little shorter than herself, whose
childishly meagre skirts were in odd contrast
with the protecting old-fashioned manner in
which she supported her mother, and whispered
to her not to cry, they would be all
right.</p>

<p>I made myself known rather awkwardly,
for when I raised my hat and said, 'Mrs.
Ellmer, I think,' they only walked on a
little faster. The case was too serious with
them, however, for me to allow myself to be
easily rebuffed. I followed them with a long
and lame speech of introduction.</p>

<p>'Don't you remember&mdash;five years ago&mdash;in
the Strand, when you were acting at the
"Vaudeville"&mdash;Mr. Fabian Scott?'</p><p><span class="pagenum">[86]</span></p>

<p>Babiole stopped and whispered something;
Mrs. Ellmer stopped too, and held
out her hand with a wan smile and a sudden
change to a rather effusive manner.</p>

<p>'I beg your pardon, I am sure. I remember
perfectly, Mr. Scott introduced you
to me as a very old friend of his. You will
excuse me, won't you? One doesn't expect
to see gentlemen from town in these uncivilised
parts. Babiole, my dear, you remember
Mr.&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Maude,' said I. 'It is very good of you
to remember me at all, after such a long
time. But I couldn't resist the temptation of
speaking to you; one sees, as you say, so
few beings up here whom one likes to call
fellow-creatures. Miss Babiole, you've
"growed out of knowledge." I suppose
you haven't seen much of our friend Fabian
lately, Mrs. Ellmer?'</p>

<p>'No, indeed. I went on tour at the end<span class="pagenum">[87]</span>
of the season when I first had the pleasure
of meeting you, and we have been touring
ever since.'</p>

<p>'Don't you get tired of the incessant
travelling? I suppose you seldom stay
more than a week at each place?'</p>

<p>'Sometimes only two or three nights. It
is extremely fatiguing. In fact, I am going
to take a rest for a short time, for I find the
nightly work too much for me in my present
state of health,' said she, with a brave
attempt to check the tremor in her voice,
which was unspeakably piteous to me who
knew the true reason of the 'rest.'</p>

<p>'If you are going to stay in Aberdeen, I
hope you will allow me to call upon you. I
live near Ballater, forty miles away in the
country, so you may guess how thankfully I
snatch at a chance of seeing a little society.'</p>

<p>At the word 'society' Mrs. Ellmer
laughed almost hysterically.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[88]</span></p>

<p>'I am afraid you would find solitude
livelier than our society,' she said, with a
pitiful attempt to be sprightly.</p>

<p>'Well, will you let me try?'</p>

<p>'Really, Mr. Maude, when we are in the
country we live in such a very quiet way.
Of course it's different when one is in town
and has one's own servants; and these
Scotch people have no notion of waiting at
table or serving things decently.'</p>

<p>'I know, I know,' I broke in eagerly.
'I'm used to all that myself. Why, I live in
a tumble-down old house with a monkey and
a soldier for my household, so you may judge
that I have got used to the discomforts of the
North.'</p>

<p>I saw Babiole stealthily shake her mother's
arm, and move her lips in a faint 'Yes, yes,'.
Reluctantly, and with more excuses for
having let the agent-in-advance take lodgings
for them which they would not have<span class="pagenum">[89]</span>
looked at had they known what a low
neighbourhood they were in, Mrs. Ellmer at
last consented that I should call and take tea
with them next day.</p>

<p>I went back to my hotel and engaged a
room for the night. The poor woman's
sunken face haunted me even in my sleep;
and I grew nervous when half-past four
came, lest I should hear on arriving at the
bare and dirty-looking stone house which I
had already taken care to find out, that she
was dead. However, my fears had run away
with me. On my knocking at the door of
the top flat of the little house, Babiole opened
it, pretty and smiling, in a simple dress of
some sort of brown stuff, with lace and a red
necklace round her fair slim throat. She
had not seen my face before by daylight;
and I saw, by the flash of horror that passed
quickly over her features and was gone, how
much the sight shocked her.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[90]</span></p>

<p>'I was afraid you would forget to come,
perhaps,' she said, in the prim little way I
remembered, as she led the way into a small
room, in which no one less used to the shifts
of travel than I was could have detected the
ingenious artifices by which a washhand-stand
became a sideboard, and a wardrobe
a book-case. The popular Scotch plan
of sleeping in a cupboard disposed of the
bed.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ellmer looked better. Whether
influenced by her daughter's keen perception
that I was a friend in time of need, or
pleasantly excited at the novelty of receiving
a visitor, there was more spontaneity than I
had expected in her voluble welcome, more
brightness in the inevitable renewal of her
excuses for the simplicity of their surroundings.
To me, after my long exile from
everything fair or gentle in the way of
womanhood, the bare little room was<span class="pagenum">[91]</span>
luxurious enough with that pretty young
creature in it; for Babiole, though she had
lost much of her childish beauty, and was
rapidly approaching the 'gawky' stage of a
tall girl's development, had a softness in her
blue eyes when she looked at her mother,
which now seemed to me more charming
than the keen glance of unusual intellect.
She had, too, the natural refinement of all
gentle natures, and had had enough stage
training to be more graceful than girls of her
age generally are. Altogether, she interested
me greatly, so that I cast about in my mind
for some way of effectually helping them,
without destroying all chance of my meeting
them soon again.</p>

<p>Babiole brought in the tea herself, while
Mrs. Ellmer carefully explained that Mrs.
Firth, the landlady, had such odd notions of
laying the table and such terribly noisy
manners, that, for the sake of her mother's<span class="pagenum">[92]</span>
nerves, Babiole had undertaken this little
domestic duty herself. But, from a glimpse
I caught later of Mrs. Firth's hands, as she
held the kitchen-door to spy at my exit from
behind it, I think there may have been
stronger reasons for keeping her in the
background when an aristocratic and presumably
cleanly visitor was about.</p>

<p>Babiole did not talk much, but when, in
the course of the evening, I fell to describing
Larkhall and the country around it, in
deference to poor Mrs. Ellmer's thirsty wish
to know more of the rollicking luxury of my
bachelor home, the girl's eyes seemed to
grow larger with intense interest; and, after
a quick glance at my face, which had, I saw,
an unspeakable horror for her, she fixed her
eyes on the fire, and remained as quiet as a
statue while I enlarged on the good qualities
of my monkey, my birds, my dog, and the
view from my study window of the Muick<span class="pagenum">[93]</span>
just visible now between the bare branches
of the birch-trees.</p>

<p>'I should like to live right among the hills
like that,' she said softly, when her mother
had exhausted her expressions of admiration.</p>

<p>'Would you? You would find it very
lonely. In winter you would be snowed
up, as I shall most certainly be in a week or
two; and even when the roads are passable
you don't meet any one on them, except,
perhaps, a couple of peasants, whose language
would be to you as unintelligible as that of
wild animals going down into the village to
get food.'</p>

<p>'But you can live there.'</p>

<p>'Circumstances have made me solitary
everywhere.'</p>

<p>She looked up at me; her face flushed,
her lips trembled with unutterable pity, and
the tears sprang to her eyes.</p>

<p>Custom had long since made me callous<span class="pagenum">[94]</span>
to instinctive aversion, but this most unexpected
burst of intelligent sympathy made
my heart leap up. I said nothing, and began
to play with the tablecloth.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ellmer, in the belief that the pause
was an awkward one, rushed into the breach,
and disturbed my sweet feeling rather uncouthly.</p>

<p>'I am sure, Mr. Maude, no one thinks the
worse of you for the accident, whatever it
was, that disfigured you. For my part, I
always prefer plain men to handsome ones;
they're more intelligent, and don't think so
much of themselves.'</p>

<p>Babiole gave her mother an alarmed
pleading look, which happily absorbed my
attention and neutralised the effect of this
speech. I could have borne worse things
than poor Mrs. Ellmer's rather tactless and
insipid conversation for the sake of watching
her daughter's mobile little face, and I am<span class="pagenum">[95]</span>
afraid they must have wished me away long
before I could make up my mind to go.
Babiole came to the outer door with me, and
I seized the opportunity to ask her what they
were going to do.</p>

<p>'Mrs. Ellmer doesn't look strong enough
to act again at present,' I suggested.</p>

<p>The girl's face clouded.</p>

<p>'No. And even if she were, you see&mdash;&mdash;'
She stopped.</p>

<p>'Of course. Her place would be filled
up?'</p>

<p>'Yes,' very sorrowfully. Then she looked
up again, her face grown suddenly bright
and hopeful, as with a flash of sunshine.
'But you needn't be afraid for us. Mamma
is so clever, and I am young and strong; we
shall be all right. We should be all right
now if only&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'If only?'</p>

<p>'Why, you see, you mustn't think it's<span class="pagenum">[96]</span>
mamma's fault that we are left in a corner
like this; you don't know how she can save
and manage on&mdash;oh! so little. But whenever
she has, by care and making things do,
saved up a little money, it&mdash;it all goes, you
know.'</p>

<p>The sudden reserve which showed itself
in her ingenuous manner towards the last
words was so very suggestive that the true
explanation of this phenomenon flashed upon
my mind.</p>

<p>'Then somebody else puts in a claim,' I
suggested.</p>

<p>The girl laughed a little, her full and
sensitive red lips opening widely over ivory-white
even teeth, and she nodded appreciation
of my quick perception.</p>

<p>'Somebody else wants such a lot of things
that somebody else's wife and daughter can
do without,' she said, with a comical little
look of resignation. And, encouraged by<span class="pagenum">[97]</span>
my sympathetic silence, she went on, 'And
he has so much talent, Mr. Maude. If he
would only go on painting as poor mamma
goes on acting, he could make us all rich&mdash;if
he liked. And instead of that&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Babiole!' cried her mother's voice, rather
tartly.</p>

<p>'Yes, mamma.' Then she added, low
and quickly, with a frightened glance back
in the dusk, towards the door of their room,
'It's high treason to say even so much as
this, but it is so hard to know how she tries
and yet not to speak of it to any one. I
don't mean to blame my father, Mr. Maude,
but you know what men are&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>It seemed to occur to her that this was an
indiscreet remark, but I said 'Yes, yes,' with
entire concurrence; for indeed who should
know what men were better than I? After
this she seemed as anxious to get rid of me as
civility allowed, but I had something to say.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[98]</span></p>

<p>I gabbled it out fast and nervously, in a
husky whisper, lest mamma's sharp ear should
catch my proposal, and she should nip it in
the bud.</p>

<p>'Look here, Miss Babiole; if you like the
hills, and you don't mind the cold, and your
mother wants a rest and a change, listen. I
was just going to advertise for some one to
act as caretaker in a little lodge I've got&mdash;scarcely
more than a cottage, but a little
place I don't want to go to rack and ruin.
If you and she could exist there in the winter&mdash;it
is a place where peat may be had for
the asking, and it really isn't an uncomfortable
little box, and I can't tell you what a
service you would be doing me if you would
persuade your mother to live in it until&mdash;until
I find a tenant, you know. In summer
I can get a splendid rent for the place, tiny
as it is, if only I can find some one to keep
it from going to pieces in the meantime. It's<span class="pagenum">[99]</span>
not badly furnished,' I hurried on mendaciously,
'and there's an old woman to do the
housework&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>But here Babiole, who had been drinking
in my words with parted lips and starlight
eyes like a child at its first pantomime,
dazzled, bewildered, delighted, drew herself
straight up, and became suddenly prim.</p>

<p>'In that case, Mr. Maude,' said she, with
demure pride that resented the suspicion of
charity, 'if the old woman can take care of
the house, surely she doesn't want two other
people to take care of her.'</p>

<p>'But I tell you she's dead!' I burst out
angrily, annoyed at my blundering. 'There
was an old woman to look after the place,
but she was seventy-four, and she died the
week before last, of old age&mdash;nothing infectious.
Now, look here; you tell your
mother about it, and see if you can't persuade
her to oblige me. I'm sure the<span class="pagenum">[100]</span>
change would do her good; for it's very
healthy there. Why, you know the Queen
lives within eight miles of my house, and
you may be sure her Majesty wouldn't be
allowed to live anywhere where the air
wasn't good. Now, will you promise to try?'</p>

<p>She said 'Yes,' and I knew, from the low
earnest whisper in which she breathed out
the word, that she meant it with all her soul.
I left her and almost ran back to my hotel,
as excited as a schoolboy, longing for the
next morning to come, so that I could go
back to Broad Street, and learn the fate of
my new freak. Any one who had witnessed
my anxiety would have decided at once that
I must be in love with either the mother or
the daughter; but I was not. The promise
of a new interest in life, of a glimpse of
pleasant society up in my hills, and the fancy
we all occasionally have for being kind to
something, were all as strong as my pity for<span class="pagenum">[101]</span>
the mother, my admiration for the daughter,
and my respect for both.</p>

<p>I was debating next morning how soon it
would be discreet to call, when a note was
brought to me, which had been left 'by a
young lady.' I tore it open like a frantic
lover. It was from Mrs. Ellmer, an oddly
characteristic letter, alternately frosty and
gushing, but not without the dignity of the
hard-working. She said a great deal ceremoniously
about my kindness, a great deal
about her friends in London, her position
and that of 'my husband, a well-known artist,
whom you doubtless are acquainted with by
name.' But she wound up by saying that
since her health required that she should
have change of air, and since I had been so
very kind that she could scarcely refuse to
do me any service which she could conscientiously
perform, she would be happy to act
as caretaker of my house, and to keep it in<span class="pagenum">[102]</span>
order during the winter for future tenants,
provided I would be kind enough to understand
that she and her daughter would do
all the work of the house, and further that
they might be permitted to reside in a
strictly private manner.</p>

<p>'Strictly private!' I laughed heartily to
myself at this expression. The dear lady
could hardly wish for more privacy than she
would get with four or five feet of snow piled
up before her door. I was quite light-hearted
at my success, and I had to tone down my
manner to its usual grave and melancholy
pitch before I knocked again at their door.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ellmer opened the door herself, thus
disappointing me a little; Babiole's simple
confidences, which I liked to think were the
result not only of natural frankness, but of
instinctive trust in me, were pleasanter to listen
to than her mother's more artificial conversation.
We were both very dignified, both<span class="pagenum">[103]</span>
ceremoniously grateful to each other, and
when we entered the sitting-room and began
to discuss preliminaries in a somewhat pompous
and long-winded manner, Babiole sat,
quiet as a mouse, in a corner, as if afraid to
disturb by a breath the harmonious settlement
of a plan on which she had set her heart.</p>

<p>At last all was arranged. It was now
Monday; Mrs. Ellmer and her daughter were
to hold themselves in readiness to enter into
possession by the following Friday or Saturday,
when I should return to Aberdeen to
escort them to Larkhall Lodge. I rose to
take my leave, not with the easy feeling of
equality of the day before, but with deep
humility, and repeated assurances of gratitude,
to which Mrs. Ellmer replied with mild and
dignified protest.</p>

<p>But, in the passage, Babiole danced lightly
along to the door like a kitten, and holding
up her finger as a sign to me to keep silence,<span class="pagenum">[104]</span>
she clapped her hands noiselessly and nodded
to me several times in deliciously confiding
freemasonry.</p>

<p>'I worked hard for it,' she said at last in a
very soft whisper, her red lips forming the
words carefully, near to my ear. 'Good-bye,
Mr. Maude,' she then said aloud and demurely,
but with her eyes dancing. And she
gave my hand a warm squeeze as she shook
it, and let me out into the nipping Scotch air
in the gloom of the darkening afternoon, with
a new and odd sense of a flash of brightness
and warmth into the world.</p>

<p>Then I walked quickly along, devising by
what means that cottage, which my guilty soul
told me was bare of a single stick, could be
furnished and habitable by Friday. And a
cold chill crept through my bones as a new
and hitherto unthought-of question thrust
itself up in my mind:</p>

<p>What would Ferguson say?</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum">[105]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/ch06.jpg" width="400" height="128" alt="" />
</div>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p>I made a hasty tour of the second-hand shops
in Aberdeen, being wise enough to know that
if she were to find the cottage too spick and
span, Mrs. Ellmer would in a moment discover
my pious fraud. Having got together
in this way a very odd assortment of furniture,
I was rather at a loss about kitchen utensils,
when I was seized with the happy inspiration
of buying a new set of them for my own service,
and handing over those at present in use
in my kitchen to Mrs. Ellmer. Not knowing
much about these things, I had to buy in a
wholesale fashion, more, I fancy, to the advantage
of the seller than to my own. However,<span class="pagenum">[106]</span>
the business was got through somehow, the
things were to be sent on the following day,
and I sneaked back to Ballater by the 4.35
train, wondering how I should break the
news to Ferguson, and wishing that by some
impossible good luck the immaculate one
might have committed in my absence some
slight breach of discipline which would give
me for once the superior position. If I could
only find him drunk! But though second to
none in his fondness for whiskey, nobody but
himself could tell when he had had more than
enough; so that hope was vain.</p>

<p>It was not that I was afraid of Ferguson;
far from it. But his punctuality, his unflagging
mechanical industry, his many uncompromising
virtues made him a person to be
reckoned with; and it would have been easier
to own to a caprice inconsistent with one's
principles to a more intellectual person than
to him.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[107]</span></p>

<p>It was getting dark before the train stopped
at Ballater, a few minutes before six. I had
to go through the village, over the rickety
wooden bridge&mdash;for the new one of stone was
not built then&mdash;and along the road which lies
on the south side of the Dee. The hills were
on my left, their bases covered with slim
birch-trees, whose bare branches swayed and
hissed like whips in the winter wind; on the
right, below the road, ran the crooked turbulent
little stream of Dee, now swollen with
late autumn rains, swirling round its many
curves, and rushing between the piles of the
bridge till the wooden structure rocked again.
Would those two delicate women be frightened
away by the cold and the loneliness from
the nest I was building for them, I wondered,
as I turned to the right to cross the little
stone bridge that arches over the Muick just
before that stream runs into the Dee. I
stopped and looked around me. There was<span class="pagenum">[108]</span>
a faint white light over the western hills
which enabled me to see dim outlines of the
objects I knew. Just beyond the bridge was
the forsaken little churchyard of Glenmuick,
which not even a ghost would care to haunt,
where now a cluster of gaunt bare ash-trees
thrust up spectral arms from the ground among
the mildewed grave-stones. The lonely
manse, a plain stone house shadowed by
dark evergreens, stood back a little from the
road on the opposite side. A mile away,
with the rushing Dee between, the spire of
Ballater church stood up among the roofs of
the village, flanked by fir-crowned Craigendarroch
on the north, and the Pannanich
Hills on the south. Straight on my road lay
between flat Lowland fields to a ragged fringe
of tall firs behind which, on a rising ground,
the shell of an old deserted dwelling, known
as Knock Castle, served in summer as a
meagre shelter for the Highland sheep in<span class="pagenum">[109]</span>
sudden storms. At this point the road turned
sharply to the left, the fringe of fir-trees growing
thicker upon the skirts of the forest; a
few paces farther this road divided into two
branches which struck off from each other in
the form of a V, the southernmost one leading
to Larkhall through a mile of fir-forest.
Would the very approach to their new abode
through this dark and winding road depress
the poor little women into looking upon the
cottage as a prison, after the life and movement
they were used to?</p>

<p>The private road which led through my
own plantation to the house was divided
from the public thoroughfare by no lodge,
no gate, but ran modestly down between
borders of grass, which grew long and rank
in the summer time, for about half a mile,
until, the larches and Scotch firs growing
more sparsely to the south, one caught wider
and wider glimpses of broad green meadows<span class="pagenum">[110]</span>
where two or three horses were turned out
to find a meagre pasture. Here the drive
was carried over a little iron ornamental
bridge, which crossed a stream that was but
a thread in the warm weather; and leaving
the grass and the trees behind, one came
upon a broad lawn which ran right up to the
walls of the house, flanked to the north by
more grass and more trees, which shut out
the view of the stables and of the unused
cottage. To the south the land made a
sudden dip, and the hollow thus formed was
laid out as a garden, while the great bank
that sheltered it formed a succession of
terraces from which one caught glimpses of
the rushing Muick between the birches that
lined the banks of the impetuous little
stream.</p>

<p>The house was a most unpretentious
building, in the plainest style of Scotch
country-house architecture, with rough<span class="pagenum">[111]</span>
cream-coloured walls, a tiled roof, small
irregular windows, and a mean little porch.
It was only saved from ugliness by a
growth of ivy over the lower portion and by
a freak of the designer, whereby one end
was raised a story above the rest, and the
roof of this portion made to slope north and
south, instead of east and west, like that of
the rest of the building. At the back the
firs and larches rose to a great height, the
house seeming to nestle under their protection
whenever the winter storms burst over
the bleak hills around.</p>

<p>Ferguson was glad to see me, and welcomed
me back with a cordiality which
made my mind easier on the subject of the
announcement I had to make to him. I
went up to my room and, finding everything
prepared for me, told him I was
ready for dinner. Instead of going downstairs,
he only said, 'Yes, sir; it is<span class="pagenum">[112]</span>
coming up,' and knelt down to pull off my
boots.</p>

<p>'All right,' said I; 'I can do that. I'm
very hungry.'</p>

<p>'No doubt of it, sir,' he answered, but did
not stir. 'The fact is, sir, that knowing you
would come home hungry, and maybe very
much fatigued, and that to be in the kitchen
serving dinner and up here attending upon
you at the same time is a moral impossibility,
I made bold to ask an old and very respectable
female that was staying in the village to
give me a little help&mdash;just for this evening,
sir. She is very clean in her ways, sir, and
a most respectable and God-fearing body.'</p>

<p>I jumped at the news, and congratulated
him upon his forethought with great heartiness.</p>

<p>'I have no more objection to seeing a
woman's face about the place than you have
yourself, Ferguson,' I said cordially; 'in fact<span class="pagenum">[113]</span>
I have just given permission to two poor
ladies to pass the winter in the cottage at
the back, and I want you to help me to put
the place straight a bit for them. They
come in on Friday. I don't want the place
to fall to pieces with dry rot for want of
some one to live in it.'</p>

<p>'Ladies won't keep the dry rot out of a
place, sir,' answered Ferguson, with dry
contempt. 'However, you know best, sir,
what kind of cattle you like to harbour in
your own barns, and I daresay they'll be
snug enough till the snow comes.'</p>

<p>This dark suggestion was but the echo to
my own fears. I was so anxious to secure a
co-operation in my plan, not merely perfunctory,
but zealous, knowing well, as I did,
the highly-sensitive mood in which the elder
at least of my new tenants would arrive, that
even after this scantily-gracious speech I
humbled myself more than was meet.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[114]</span></p>

<p>'By the bye, Ferguson,' I began again
after a short pause, during which he helped
me on with my coat, 'I'm thinking of having
the little north room upstairs fitted up for
you, as a sort of&mdash;sort of housekeeper's
room, butler's room, you know.' Mine was
such a nondescript household that it was not
easy to find a designation for any of the
apartments, but I wished thus neatly to
intimate that if my mayor of the palace had
matrimonial intentions, his do-nothing king
would not stand in his way. 'Now that my
household is becoming larger, I daresay you
would like to have some place where you
and Tim and Mrs.&mdash;Miss&mdash;what did you say
her name was? could sit in the evenings.'</p>

<p>'Neither Mrs. nor Miss anything did
I say was her name,' answered Ferguson,
with grave deliberation. 'Plain Janet, sir;
she leaves titles to her betters. And the
kitchen does very well for me, sir, and for<span class="pagenum">[115]</span>
Janet too if you care to engage her as housekeeper,
after due trial of her capabilities.'</p>

<p>'Oh, if she satisfies you she will satisfy
me.'</p>

<p>'None the less I should wish you to see
her, that you may understand it was for your
better service and not for my own pleasure
that I introduced her here. I have no
opinion of women, sir, until they are past
the age for frivolity, and I'm not handsome
enough to go courting myself.'</p>

<p>Whether this was a warning to me not to
be beguiled into a fatal trust in the power of
my own beauty, and an obscure hint that in
his opinion I was in danger of making a fool
of myself, Ferguson's face was too wooden
to betray; but the manner in which he gave
his services towards putting the cottage in
order was unsatisfactory, not to say venomous.
He veiled his displeasure with my new
freak under an officious zeal for the comfort<span class="pagenum">[116]</span>
of the coming tenants, which was much
harder to deal with than stubborn unwillingness
to work for them would have been.
My assurances that one was an invalid and
the other a child only supplied him with
fresh forms of indirect attack. He was
surprised that I did not have one of the two
rooms on the ground-floor fitted up as a bedroom,
as invalids cannot walk up and down
stairs; he was kind enough to place in one
of the upper rooms, which he persisted in
calling 'the nursery,' a small wooden horse
of the primitive straight-legged kind, a penny
rattle, and a soft fluffy parrot; and when I
impatiently pitched the things out at the
door he seemed dismayed, and said 'he had
thought they would please the wee bairn.'</p>

<p>That old beast took all the pleasure out of
the little excitement of furnishing. On the
morning after my return, he took care to
present to me the respectable Janet; he had,<span class="pagenum">[117]</span>
indeed, not overrated her magnificent lack
of meretricious charms; for in the wooden
face and hard blue eyes I recognised at once
the features of my faithful attendant, additional
wrinkles taking the place of the sabre-cut.
She was his mother. As, however,
neither made any reference to this fact,
I treated it as a family secret and made no
indiscreet inquiries.</p>

<p>The eventful Friday came. I was in the
cottage as soon as it was light, making for
the last time the tour of the two bedrooms,
kitchen, and sitting-room, trying all the
windows to see that they were draught-tight,
passing my hands along the walls in
a futile attempt to find out if they were
damp. In the sitting-room I stayed a long
time, moving about the furniture, a second-hand
suite, covered with dark red reps;
I was disgusted with the mournful bareness
of the apartment, and wondered how I could<span class="pagenum">[118]</span>
have been so stupid as to forget that women
liked ornaments. I went back to my house
and ransacked it furtively for nicknacks,
without much success. First, I reviewed
the pictures: a regular bachelor's collection
they were, not objectionable from a man's
point of view, but for ladies&mdash;&mdash;. No, the
pictures were hopeless, with the exception of
huge engravings, 'The Relief of Lucknow,'
and 'Queen Philippa Begging the Lives of
the Burgesses,' which, though perfectly innocuous
to a young girl's mind, were not
exhilarating to anybody's. Besides, fancy
being caught by Ferguson staggering under
the burden of those ponderous works of art!
I had not known before how meagre were
the appointments of my home; my five
years of wandering had given me a traveller's
indifference to all but necessaries, so
that, as I looked round the study, where I
spent nearly all the time that I passed<span class="pagenum">[119]</span>
indoors, I saw little that could be spared.
It was a comfortable-looking room enough,
with its three big windows, two looking
south over the terraced garden and the
wooded valley of the Muick, the remaining
one east over the lawn and the drive, and
more trees. The west wall of the room was
filled from floor to ceiling by book-shelves of
the plainest kind; these were filled, not with
the student's methodically-arranged collection
of sombre and well-worn volumes, not
with the 'gentleman's' suspiciously neat and
bright 'complete sets' in morocco and half-calf,
which to remove seems as improper as
to scrape off the wall-paper would be; but
with the oddest of odd lots of literary ware,
in a dozen languages, in all sizes and all
varieties of binding and lack of binding, no
two volumes of anything together, and not a
book that I didn't love among them, from
Montaigne, in dear dirty paper covers,<span class="pagenum">[120]</span>
hanging by a thread, to Thackeray in a
beastly <i>&eacute;dition de luxe</i>.</p>

<p>On the north wall was the fireplace&mdash;wide,
high, old-fashioned and warm&mdash;with a discoloured
white marble mantelpiece, decorated
with fat bewigged Georgian cupids. Above
it hung an old cavalry sword with which my
father had cut his way through the Russians
at Inkermann. Close to the fireplace, and
with its back to the book-shelves, stood my
own especial chair&mdash;big, roomy, well worn&mdash;covered
with dark red morocco, like the rest
of the furniture. A reading-table stood in
the corner beside it, and on the right hand
was a bigger table, piled high with books and
papers, cigars, bills and rubbish. There was
a writing-table in one corner, at which I never
wrote; a sofa covered with more literary
lumber; two cabinets crammed with curiosities
collected on my travels, tossed in with
little attempt at arrangement; a card-table on<span class="pagenum">[121]</span>
which stood a quantity of old-fashioned silver,
such as tall candlesticks, goblets, a punch-bowl
and a massive last-century urn. A
stuffed duck, a Dutch tankard, a pair of elk's
horns, and a bust of Dante surmounted by a
fox's brush, occupied the top of the book-shelves.
A high plain fourfold screen, as
dark as the rest of the time-worn furniture,
hid the door; and close to the screen a dog-kennel,
with the front taken out and replaced
by a strong iron grating, formed the winter
home of a large brown monkey, which I had
bought at a sale with the fascinating reputation
of being dangerous, but which had belied
its character by allowing me to bring it
home on my shoulders. To-to, so called
for no better reason than that my collie,
whose favourite resting-place was now well
defined on the goatskin hearthrug, was
named Ta-ta, had from our first introduction
treated me with such marked tolerance that<span class="pagenum">[122]</span>
I, in my loneliness, had begun to feel a sort of
superstitious fondness for the brute, and
fancied I saw more reason and affection in
his blinking brown eyes than in any of the
Scotch pebbles which served as organs of
vision to my Gaelic neighbours. When I
first bought him it was mild enough for him
to live in the yard; but when the weather
grew cold, and he was brought into the kitchen,
he got on so ill with the powers there
that I had to take compassion upon him and
them, and remove To-to to the study, where
he justified his promotion by the reserve and
gravity of his manners, his only marked foible
being a furious jealousy of Ta-ta, whose resting-place
was just beyond the utmost tether
of the monkey's chain. Rarely did an evening
pass without some skirmish between the two.
Perhaps Ta-ta, seeing me smile over the book
I was reading, and anxious to share my enjoyment,
even if she could not understand the<span class="pagenum">[123]</span>
joke, would incautiously get up and wag her
tail. Whereupon To-to would dash across
the hearthrug and assist her, and much unpleasantness
would follow, the dog barking,
the monkey chattering, the master swearing&mdash;all
three members of the menagerie trying
to come off conqueror in the <i>m&ecirc;l&eacute;e</i>. Or else
To-to would fall from the top of his kennel
to the floor, with a loud noise, and would lie
stiff and still on the rug, as if in a fit; and
then the simple Ta-ta would walk over to
investigate the case, and the monkey would
seize her ears and twist them round with jabbering
triumph. I kept a small whip to
separate the combatants on these occasions,
but I only dared use it very sparingly; as,
though its effect upon To-to's coarser nature
was salutary in the extreme in reducing him
to instant love and obedience, as the boot of
the costermonger does his wife, the gentler
Ta-ta would look up at me with such piteous<span class="pagenum">[124]</span>
protest in her dark eyes that I felt a brute for
the next half hour.</p>

<p>From this room, the scene of most of my
domestic life, I took a pair of silver candlesticks
and a Dresden cup and saucer. Into
the unused drawing-room, which I had had
fitted up years ago in the Louis Quinze style,
I just peeped; but there was nothing very
tempting in white and gold curly-legged furniture
tied up in brown holland on a cold
polished floor, so I locked the door again,
and carried away my prizes to the cottage,
where they certainly improved the look of the
sitting-room mantelpiece.</p>

<p>I had no sort of carriage more convenient
than a Norfolk-cart, so on my way to Aberdeen
I ordered a fly to be at Ballater Station
on my return with my new tenants. Both
the ladies were already dressed for their
journey, and we started at once, Mrs. Ellmer
hastening to inform me that she had sent<span class="pagenum">[125]</span>
most of her luggage to some friends in London,
to account, I fancy, poor lady, for having
only one shabby trunk and two stage baskets.
Babiole sat very quietly during the railway
journey, looking out of window at the now
dreary and bleak landscape; and I spoke so
little that any one might have thought I
would rather have been alone. But, indeed,
I was only afraid, from the happy excitement
which glowed in the faces of both talkative
mother and silent daughter, lest their bright
expectations should be disappointed by the
simplicity and desolation of the place they
persisted in regarding as a palace of delights.</p>

<p>'It's a very homely place, you know,' I
said solemnly, after being bantered in a
sprightly manner by Mrs. Ellmer upon my
artfulness in building myself a fortress up in
the hills where, like the knights of old, I
could indulge in what lawless pranks I
pleased. 'And I assure you that nothing<span class="pagenum">[126]</span>
could possibly be more simple than my mode
of life there. Whatever of the bold bad
bandit there may have been in my composition
ten years back has been melted down
into mere harmless eccentricity long ago.'</p>

<p>'Ah! you are not going to make me believe
that,' said Mrs. Ellmer, with a giddy
shake of the head. 'Why, the very name
Larkhall betrays you.'</p>

<p>I believe the dear lady really did think the
name had been given in commemoration of
'high jinks' I had held there; but I hastened
to assure her that 'lark' was simply the
Highland pronunciation of 'larch,' a tree
which grew abundantly in the neighbourhood.
However, she only smiled archly, and seeing
that the imaginary iniquities she seemed bent
on imputing to me in no way lessened her
exuberant happiness in my society, I left my
character in her hands, with only a glance at
Babiole, who seemed, with her eyes fixed<span class="pagenum">[127]</span>
on the moving landscape, to be deaf to what
went on inside the carriage. I was rather
glad of it.</p>

<p>When we got to Ballater the little shed of
a station was crowded by rough villagers, all
eagerly enjoying the splendid excitement of
the arrival of the train. A dense, wet Scotch
mist enveloped us as we stepped on to the
platform, chilled by our cold journey; still,
they both smiled with persistent happiness,
which grew rapturous when we all got into a
roomy fly which Mrs. Ellmer called 'your
carriage.' They were charmed with the village,
which looked, through the veil of fine
rain, a most depressing collection of stiff stone
and slate dwellings to my <i>blas&eacute;</i> eyes. They
were delighted with the cold and dreary
drive. They pronounced the dark fir-forest
through which we drove 'magnificent'; and,
finally, after a hushed and reverential silence
as we went through the plantation, both were<span class="pagenum">[128]</span>
transfixed with admiration at the sight of my
modest dwelling. Mrs. Ellmer even went so
far as to admire the 'fine rugged face' of
Ferguson, who was standing at the hall door
scowling his worst scowl. I did not risk an
encounter with him, but led the ladies straight
into the cottage, where a peat fire was glowing
in each of the lower rooms. We went
first into the sitting-room; a lighted lamp was
in the middle of the table, the tea-things were
at one end. I glanced from mother to daughter,
trying to read their first impression of
their new home. Mrs. Ellmer's eyes, sharpened
by sordid experience to hungry keenness,
took in every detail at once with critical satisfaction,
while her lips poured forth commonplaces
of vague delight. The climax of her
pleasure was the discovery of the cup and
saucer on the mantelpiece. By the way in
which her thin face lighted up I saw she was
a connoisseur. In looking at it she forgot<span class="pagenum">[129]</span>
me and for a moment paused in her enraptured
monologue.</p>

<p>Babiole took it all differently. She
seemed to hold her breath as she looked
slowly round, as if determined to gaze on
everything long enough to be sure that it
was real; then, with a little sob, she turned
her head quickly, and her innocent eyes,
soft and bright with unspeakable gratitude,
fell on me.</p>

<p>You must have been for years an object
of horror and loathing to your fellow-men to
know what that look, going straight from
soul to soul with no thought of the defects of
the bodily envelope, was to me. Perhaps it
was because my life had so long been barren
of all pleasures dependent on my fellow-creatures
that I could neither then, nor later
that evening when I was alone, recall any
sensation akin to its effect in sweetness or
vividness except the glow I had felt after<span class="pagenum">[130]</span>
Babiole's girlish confidence to me at the
door of the Aberdeen lodging. I suppose
I must have stood smiling at the child
with grotesque happiness, for Mrs. Ellmer,
turning from contemplation of the cup and
saucer, drew her thin lips together very
sourly.</p>

<p>'And now I will leave you to your tea,'
said I hastily. 'I told Janet to put everything
ready for you.'</p>

<p>'Thank you, Mr. Maude, you are too
good. We require no waiting on, I assure
you,' broke in Mrs. Ellmer, with rather tart
civility.</p>

<p>'Oh no, I only told her to put the kettle
on in the kitchen,' I protested humbly. And,
with ceremonious hopes that they would be
comfortable, I retreated, Babiole giving my
fingers a warm-hearted squeeze when it came
to her turn to shake hands. The child was
following me to let me out when her mother<span class="pagenum">[131]</span>
interposed and came with me to the door
herself.</p>

<p>She took my hand and held it while she
assured me that she was so much overpowered
by my distinguished kindness and
courtesy that I must excuse her if, in the
effort to express her feelings adequately, she
found herself without words. I'm sure I
wished she would, for she went on in the
same strain, making convulsive little clutches
at my fingers to emphasise her speech, until
both she and I began to shiver. She did
not let me go until Babiole appeared behind
her, flushed and smiling, in the little passage.
Then Mrs. Ellmer's fingers sprang up from
mine like an opened latch and, dismissed, I
raised my hat and hurried off.</p>

<p>I had not gone half a dozen yards when I
met Janet on her way to the cottage; she
curtseyed and told me, in answer to my
question, that she was taking some tea<span class="pagenum">[132]</span>
to the ladies. After a moment's hesitation
I turned and followed her, proposing to
ask them whether they would like some
books.</p>

<p>Janet opened the door quietly without
knocking, and went into the kitchen on the
left, while I stood on the rough fibre mat
outside the sitting-room, having grown
suddenly shy about intruding again. I
heard Babiole's clear childish voice.</p>

<p>'Oh, mamma, if only papa doesn't find us
out, how happy we shall be here! Mr.
Maude is a good man, I am sure of it!'</p>

<p>'As good as the rest of them, I daresay,'
answered her mother in tones of pure
vinegar. 'Understand, if you ever meet
him when I'm not with you, you are not
to speak to him. It makes me ill to look
at his hideous wicked face. There's someone
in the kitchen, run and see who it
is.'</p><p><span class="pagenum">[133]</span></p>

<p>And the poor Beast, thinking he had
heard enough, and afraid lest Beauty should
catch him eavesdropping, slunk away from
the door-mat and made his way home with
his tail between his legs.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p>Those unlucky few words that I had overheard
created a great breach between me
and my tenants, and, moreover, brought on
in the would-be philosopher a fit of misanthropical
melancholy. I could not get over
the poor little woman's cynical hypocrisy for
some days, during which I never went near
the cottage; and if I met either mother or
daughter in my walks or rides, I contented
myself with raising my hat ceremoniously,
and giving them as brief a glimpse of my
'wicked hideous face' as possible. Ha!
ha! I would show them whether or not I
was dependent on their society, and how<span class="pagenum">[135]</span>
much of selfish libertinism there had been
in my wish to house them comfortably for
the winter; a pair of idiots!</p>

<p>But this noble pride wore itself out in a
fortnight, at the end of which time I began
to think it was I who was the idiot, to
nourish resentment against a pair of helpless
creatures who, too poor to refuse an offer
which saved them from brutality and starvation,
had seen enough of the dark side of
human nature to put small faith in disinterested
motives, and had no weapon but
their own wits wherewith to fight their natural
enemy&mdash;man. Besides, my solitude had
grown ten times more solitary now that,
sitting alone in my study at night, with To-to
languidly stretching himself on the kennel
in front of me, paying no attention to
me whatever, and Ta-ta, who really had
capacities for sympathy, lying asleep on the
rug at my feet, I knew that, not a hundred<span class="pagenum">[136]</span>
yards away, there were slender women's
forms flitting about, and girlish prattle going
on, by a little modest fireside that was a
home.</p>

<p>So I suddenly remembered that I ought to
call and ask them if they found their new
home to their liking. Anxious, for the first
time for five years, to make the best of a bad
business, so far as my person was concerned,
I exchanged the coarse tweed Norfolk suit I
usually wore for a black coat and gray
trousers I used to wear in town, which,
though doubtless a little old-fashioned in cut,
might reasonably be supposed to pass muster
in the wilds, and even to give me a rather
dashing appearance. But, alas! It did not.
It showed me, on the contrary, how far I had
slipped away from civilisation. My hair was
too long, what complexion I had left too
weather-beaten, while the seamed and scarred
right side of my face looked more hideous<span class="pagenum">[137]</span>
than ever. I changed back quickly to my
usual coat, scarcely acknowledging to myself
that some sort of vague wish to live once
more the life of other men was disappointed.</p>

<p>I found Mrs. Ellmer and her daughter in
their outdoor dress; they had been driven in
by a snow shower, one of the first of the
season. The sitting-room looked now cosy
and habitable, if a little untidy, the habits of
the touring actress being still manifest in a
collection of unframed cabinet photographs&mdash;not
all uncalculated to bring a blush to the
Presbyterian cheek&mdash;which stood in a row on
the mantelpiece. It occurred to me that old
Janet might have let out the fact that I
turned back with her to the cottage and,
perhaps, overheard something to my disadvantage,
for Babiole looked frightened and
shy, and Mrs. Ellmer's manner was almost
apologetically humble. There was constraint
enough upon us all for me to make my visit<span class="pagenum">[138]</span>
very short, but as I left I formally invited
them to dine with me on the following
evening.</p>

<p>With what shamefaced <i>nonchalance</i> I told
Ferguson that day to have the drawing-room
opened and cleaned on the following morning!
With what stolid lowering resignation he
extracted my reason for this unparalleled
order! However, he made no protest. But
next morning, while I was at breakfast, he
entered the room in his usual clockwork
manner, but with a glow of pleasurable
feeling in his cold eyes.</p>

<p>'If you please, sir, Janet would be obliged if
you would step into the drawing-room and see
if you would still wish to have it prepared for
the party this evening.'</p>

<p>Party! I could have broken his neck.
But I only followed him in an easy manner
into the hall. It was full of blinding smoke,
which was pouring forth from the open door<span class="pagenum">[139]</span>
of the drawing-room. I dashed heroically
into the apartment, only to be met with a
denser cloud, which rushed into my mouth
and made my eyes smart and burn. Some
winged thing, either a bird or a bat, flapped
against the walls and ceiling in the gloom.
Janet was choking at the fireplace, in great
danger of being smothered.</p>

<p>'What is all this?' I choked angrily,
getting back into the hall.</p>

<p>'Nothing, sir,' answered Ferguson, with
grim delight. 'Nothing but that Janet lit
the fire to air the room in obedience to your
orders, and that the chimney smokes a little.
Would you still wish to have the room got
ready, sir?'</p>

<p>But he had gone too far; he had roused
the lion.</p>

<p>'Come in here,' I said, in a tone which
subdued his happiness; and he followed me
back into the room. 'Now t-t-take the tongs,'<span class="pagenum">[140]</span>
I continued, as haughtily as coughing would
permit, 'and r-ram it up the chimney.'</p>

<p>Cowed, but exceedingly reluctant, he
obeyed, and I would not let him relax his
efforts until, smothered with soot and dust,
dry twigs and blackened snow, he pulled
down upon himself a sack, a couple of birds'-nests,
and other obstacles which, some from
above and some from below, had been
deposited in the unused chimney.</p>

<p>'Now,' said I, purple in the face but content,
'you can relight the fire.'</p>

<p>And, satisfied with this moral victory and
the prestige it gave me in the eyes of the
whole household&mdash;for Tim and the outdoor
genius who gardened twelve acres and
looked after four horses had both enjoyed
this domestic scandal from the doorway&mdash;I
marched back to my cold coffee and congealed
bacon.</p>

<p>There were no more difficulties, though,<span class="pagenum">[141]</span>
at least none worth mentioning. It is true
that on returning from my morning's ride I
found the hall so stuffed up with furniture
that I had to enter my residence through
one of the study windows, five feet from the
ground; and that I had to picnic on a
sandwich in the study instead of lunching
decorously in the dining-room; but these
discomforts might be necessary to a thorough
cleaning, and could be borne with fortitude.
At six o'clock my guests arrived, and, having
left their cloaks in a spare-room opened for
the occasion, they were led to shiver in the
drawing-room, which still smelt of smoke and
soap and water. Mrs. Ellmer, with chattering teeth,
admired the painted ceiling, the
white satin chairs bright with embossed roses,
the pale screen, and all the fanciful glories of
the room, the magnificence of which evidently
impressed and delighted her. Babiole seemed
unable to take her eyes off two oil-paintings,<span class="pagenum">[142]</span>
both portraits of the same lady, which, in
massive gilt oval frames, occupied a prominent
position at the end of the room
opposite the fireplace.</p>

<p>'Babiole is fascinated, you see, Mr.
Maude,' said her mother, with the little
affected laugh which gave less the idea of
pleasure than that of a wish to please. 'If
she dared she would ask who those ladies
are.'</p>

<p>'They are both the same, mother,' said
Babiole, so softly, so shyly, that one could
think she guessed there was some story
about the portraits.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ellmer's eyes began to beam with
a less artless curiosity.</p>

<p>'Would it be indiscreet to ask her name?'</p>

<p>'Her name was Helen.'</p>

<p>'Ah, poor lady! She is dead, then?'</p>

<p>'No, I believe she is alive.'</p>

<p>Babiole glanced quickly from the pictures<span class="pagenum">[143]</span>
to my face and pressed her mother's hand, as
that lady was about to burst forth into more
questions. I don't know that my countenance
expressed much, for my feelings on
the subject of the original of the portrait had
long ceased to be keen; but I think the little
one, being very young, liked to make as
much as possible out of any suggestion of a
romance. I took the girl by the arm and
led her to the end of the room, where the
portraits hung.</p>

<p>'Now,' said I, 'which of these two
pictures do you like best?'</p>

<p>Babiole instantly assumed the enormous
seriousness of a child who is honoured with a
genuine appeal to its taste. After a few
moments' grave comparison of the pictures,
she turned to me, with the face of a fairy
judge, and asked solemnly&mdash;</p>

<p>'Do you mean which should I love best, or
which do I admire most as a work of art?'</p><p><span class="pagenum">[144]</span></p>

<p>This altogether unexpected question, which
came so quaintly from the childish lips, made
me laugh. Babiole turned from me to the
pictures, rather disconcerted, and Mrs. Ellmer
broke in with her sharp high voice&mdash;</p>

<p>'Babiole understands pictures; she has
had a thorough art education from her father,
Mr. Maude.'</p>

<p>'Oh yes,' said I, wondering vaguely why
mothers always show up so badly beside their
daughters. Then I turned again to the girl.
'I didn't know how clever you were, Miss
Babiole. Supposing I had two friends, one
who had known this lady and loved her, and
the other who was a great art collector.
Which portrait would each like best?'</p>

<p>Babiole decided without hesitation. 'The
art collector would like this one, and the one
who had loved her would like that,' she
said, indicating each with the glance of her
eyes.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[145]</span></p>

<p>'But the art collector's is the prettier face
of the two,' I objected.</p>

<p>'Yes; but it isn't so good.'</p>

<p>I was astonished and fascinated by the
quickness of the girl's perception.</p>

<p>'You ought to grow into an artist,' I said,
smiling. 'The pretty one was in the Academy
this year, painted by a famous artist. I heard
it was a wonderful portrait, and I commissioned
a man to buy it for me. The other is
an enlargement, by an unknown artist, from
half a dozen old photographs and sketches,
of the same lady five years ago.'</p>

<p>'And is it exactly like her&mdash;like what she
was, I mean?'</p>

<p>'No; she was prettier, but not so&mdash;good.'</p>

<p>I used the word 'good' because she had
used it, though it was not the word I should
have chosen. I wanted her to say something
more, for she was still looking at the pictures
in a very thoughtful way; but at that<span class="pagenum">[146]</span>
moment Mrs. Ellmer, skipping lightly along
the polished floor in a way that made me
tremble for her balance, thrust her head between
us, and laid her pointed chin on her
daughter's shoulder.</p>

<p>'And what are you two so deeply interested
about?' she asked playfully.</p>

<p>Babiole put her tender little cheek lovingly
against her mother's thin face, and I began
talking about art in a vague and ignorant
manner, which incautiously showed that I
disliked the interruption. Ferguson came to
my rescue with the solemn announcement of
dinner.</p>

<p>From Mrs. Ellmer's rather critical attitude
towards the different dishes, I gathered
that she prided herself on her own cookery,
and Babiole ingenuously let out that mamma
had once superintended a very grand dinner
of some friends of theirs&mdash;'Oh, such rich
people!'&mdash;and it had been a great success.<span class="pagenum">[147]</span>
Mamma seemed a little uneasy at this indiscretion,
but hastened to add that they were
such dear friends of hers that when they were
left in a difficulty by the sudden illness of
their man-cook&mdash;a man who had been in the
first families, and had come to them from
Lord Stonehaven's&mdash;she had overwhelmed
them by the offer of her services.</p>

<p>'I think all ladies should learn cooking,
Mr. Maude; and, indeed, many do now.
The lessons are very expensive, certainly;
but one never regrets either the time or the
money when it is once learned,' said she.
'Servants never understand how things
ought to be done unless there is some one
able to give them a little guidance.'</p>

<p>To all this conversation Ferguson listened
with the amiability of an enraged bear restrained
by iron bars from making a meal of
his tormentors.</p>

<p>Babiole had little attention to spare for<span class="pagenum">[148]</span>
any one but Ta-ta, with whom she had struck
up a rapidly ripening friendship.</p>

<p>'Ta-ta has taken a fancy to you,' I said,
smiling. 'She always likes the people I
like,' I added, with the common fatuity of
owners of pet animals.</p>

<p>Upon this Mrs. Ellmer piped out 'Ta-ta,
Ta-ta, Ta-ta!' until, to stop her, I beckoned
the dog to her side of the table. But the
collie, seeing that she had nothing better
than a raisin to offer, merely sniffed at it,
avoided the threatened caress, and slunk
back to her old place by Babiole, in whose
lap she rested her head contentedly.</p>

<p>While her mother was still laughing shrilly
at this misadventure, the child asked if they
might see my monkey.</p>

<p>'Shall I take you to my study now,' said
I, 'and show you how an old bachelor passes
his evenings?'</p>

<p>'Is the monkey fond of you too, Mr.<span class="pagenum">[149]</span>
Maude?' asked Babiole, as I opened the
door for them.</p>

<p>'I flatter myself that he is. At least I
can boast that he flies at any one whom he
suspects of doing me harm. Two months
ago a doctor was attending me for a swelling
on my neck. He came day after day, and
To-to treated him with all the courtesy due
to an honoured guest, until he decided one
day that the swelling ought to be lanced, and
took from his pocket a case of instruments.
He had scarcely opened it when To-to,
chattering and grimacing, sprang across the
hearthrug with such violence that he broke
his chain, and fastened his teeth in the
doctor's hand.'</p>

<p>'What a savage brute!' exclaimed Mrs.
Ellmer.</p>

<p>Babiole thought it out as we crossed the
hall, and then spoke gravely&mdash;</p>

<p>'But the monkey was wrong, for the<span class="pagenum">[150]</span>
doctor never meant to hurt you,' she said,
in her deliberate way.</p>

<p>'I suppose you gave him a good beating,'
said Mrs. Ellmer.</p>

<p>'No, I didn't. I scolded him till we were
alone together, for the sake of the doctor's
feelings. But when he was gone I sneaked
up to To-to's kennel and stroked him and
gave him a beautiful bone. The scolding
was for the mistake, you know, and the bone
for the devotion.'</p>

<p>We entered the study, Mrs. Ellmer first,
I last. The alarmed lady, on coming round
the screen, was close to the monkey before
she saw him. To-to only blinked up at her
composedly, with no demonstration of hostility;
but to my horror and amazement, no
sooner did he catch sight of Babiole, who
came up to him bravely by my side, with her
little hand cordially outstretched towards him,
than he made a savage spring at her, his<span class="pagenum">[151]</span>
teeth and eyes gleaming with malice. I was
just in time to draw her back in my arms, so
that he fell to the ground instead of fastening
on her poor little wrist. Mrs. Ellmer
screamed, Ta-ta began to bark and make
judiciously-distanced rushes at the monkey;
while Babiole recovered herself, very pale,
but quite quiet, and I, strangely excited, gave
To-to a sharp blow.</p>

<p>'Oh, don't!' cried the child; but then,
smiling archly, though the colour driven
away by the little fright had not yet come
back to her cheek, she added, 'but you will
give him a bone as a reward when we are
gone.'</p>

<p>'Do you think so?' said I, in a rather
constrained voice. Then, seeing that Mrs.
Ellmer's eyes were fixed curiously upon me,
I added, 'The first mistake, you see, was
excusable; there was a reason for it. But
this attack was unprovoked.'</p><p><span class="pagenum">[152]</span></p>

<p>'Yes,' said Babiole na&iuml;vely; 'for how
could I do you any harm?'</p>

<p>'Yes, how indeed?' said I.</p>

<p>But even as I said this, and looked at her
blue-eyed face, I thought that perhaps the
monkey might prove to be wiser than either
of us, unless I grew wiser as she grew older.</p>

<p>The rest of the evening passed pleasantly
enough in the ransacking of my cabinets of
curiosities; Mrs. Ellmer, who proved to be
a connoisseur of more things than china,
took delight in the value of the treasures
themselves, while Babiole pleased herself
with such as she thought beautiful, and enjoyed
particularly the stories I told about the
places I had found them in, and the ways in
which I had picked them up. She grew
radiant over the present of a Venetian bead
necklace, such as can be bought in the Burlington
Arcade for a few shillings; but when
I told her it was a souvenir from a woman<span class="pagenum">[153]</span>
whose child I had saved from drowning, her
joy in her new treasure was suddenly turned
to reverence. How did I do it? It was a
very simple story; a little boy of four or five
had slipped into one of the canals, and I,
passing in a gondola, had caught his clothes,
or rather his rags, and handed the choking
squalling manikin back into the custody of a
black-eyed, brown-skinned woman, who had
insisted, with impulsive but coquettish gratitude,
on presenting me with the beads she
wore round her own neck.</p>

<p>'Wasn't she in rags, too, then?' asked
Babiole.</p>

<p>'Oh no, she was rather picturesquely got
up.'</p>

<p>'Then, I should think, she was not his
mother at all.'</p>

<p>'Perhaps not. But all mothers are not
like yours.'</p>

<p>'I <i>know</i> that,' cooed the girl, tucking her<span class="pagenum">[154]</span>
hand lovingly under the maternal arm.
Then, after a pause, she said, 'What a lot
of nice places and people you must have
seen in all the years you have travelled
about, Mr. Maude.'</p>

<p>'How old do you think I am, then?' I
asked, struck by something in her tone.</p>

<p>She hesitated, looking shyly from me to
her mother.</p>

<p>'No, no,' said I. 'Tell me what you
think yourself.'</p>

<p>She glanced at me again, then suggested
in a small voice, 'sixty?'</p>

<p>Both Mrs. Ellmer and I began to laugh;
and the child, blushing, rubbed her cheek
against her mother's sleeve.</p>

<p>'How much would you take off from that,
Mrs. Ellmer?'</p>

<p>'Why, I'm sure you can't be a day more
than forty-five.'</p>

<p>She evidently thought I should be pleased<span class="pagenum">[155]</span>
by this, the good lady flattering herself that
she had taken off at least five years. My
first impulse was to set them right rather
indignantly, but the next moment I remembered
that I should gain nothing but a character
for mendacity by telling them that I
should not be thirty till next year. So I
only laughed again, and then Babiole's voice
broke in apologetically.</p>

<p>'I only guessed what I did, Mr. Maude,
because you are so very kind; you seem
always trying to do good to some one.'</p>

<p>'Here's a subtle and cynical little observer
for you,' said I, glancing over the child's head
at the mother. 'She knows, you see, that
benevolence is the last of the emotions, and
is only tried as a last resource when we have
used up all the others.'</p>

<p>Babiole looked much astonished at this
interpretation, which she understood very
imperfectly, and Mrs. Ellmer shook her head<span class="pagenum">[156]</span>
in arch rebuke as she rose to go. They went
upstairs together to put on their cloaks, but
Babiole came flying down before her mother
to have a last peep at the portraits which had
fascinated her. I followed her into the drawing-room,
where lamp and fire were still burning,
and she started and turned as she saw
my reflection in the long glass which hung
between the pictures.</p>

<p>'Well, are you as happy at the cottage as
you thought you would be?' I asked.</p>

<p>'Oh, happier, a thousand times. It is too
good to last,' with a frightened sigh.</p>

<p>'Don't you miss the constant change of
your travelling life, and the excitement of
acting?'</p>

<p>She seemed scarcely to understand me at
first, as she repeated, in a bewildered manner,
'excitement!' Then she said simply, 'It's
very exciting when you miss the train and
the company go on without you; but it's<span class="pagenum">[157]</span>
dreadful, too, because the manager might
telegraph to say you needn't come on at
all'.</p>

<p>'But the acting; isn't that exciting?'</p>

<p>'It's nice, sometimes, when one has a part
one likes; but, of course, I only got small
parts, and it's dreadful to have to go on with
nothing to say, or for an executioner, or an
old woman, with just a line.'</p>

<p>'And don't you like travelling?'</p>

<p>'I like it sometimes in the summer; but
in the winter it's so cold, and the places all
seem alike; and then the pantomime season
comes, and you have nothing to do.'</p>

<p>'What do you do then? What did you
do last winter, for instance?'</p>

<p>'We went back to London.'</p>

<p>'Well?'</p>

<p>But Babiole had grown suddenly shy.</p>

<p>'Won't you tell me? Would you rather
not?'</p><p><span class="pagenum">[158]</span></p>

<p>'I would rather not.'</p>

<p>At that moment Mrs. Ellmer's voice was
heard calling, in sharp tones, for 'Babiole!'</p>

<p>'Here we are, Mrs. Ellmer, taking a last
look at the pictures,' I called back, and I led
the child out into the hall, where her mother
gave a sharp glance from her to me, and
wished me good-night rather curtly. I stood
at the door to watch them on their way to
the cottage, as they would not accept my
escort; and through the keen air I distinctly
heard this question and answer&mdash;</p>

<p>'You want to get us turned out, to spend
another winter like the last, I suppose. What
did you tell him about your father?'</p>

<p>'Nothing, mother, nothing, indeed!&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>The rest of the child's passionate answer
I could not catch, as they went farther away.
But I wondered what the secret was that I
had been so near learning.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p>I enjoyed that evening so much that I was
quite ready to go through another preparatory
penance of smoking chimneys and
general topsyturveydom to have another like
it. But Fate and Ferguson ruled otherwise.
I mentioned to him one day that I
proposed inviting the ladies again for the
following evening, and he said nothing; but
when I made a state call on Mrs. Ellmer that
afternoon, she brought forward all sorts of
unexpected excuses to avoid the visit. Circumstances
had made me too diffident to
press the point, and I had to conclude, with
much mortification, that the sight of my ugly<span class="pagenum">[160]</span>
face for a whole evening had been too distressing
to their artistic eyes for them to
undergo such a trial again. They, however,
invited me to dine with them on Christmas
Day, but I was too much hurt to accept the
invitation. It was not until long afterwards
I found out that, on learning my intention of
giving another 'party,' my faithful Ferguson
had posted off to the cottage and informed
Mrs. Ellmer that his poor mother was so ill
she could scarcely keep on her legs, and now
master had ordered another 'turn out,' and
he expected it would 'do for her' altogether.
I only knew, then, that when I told him
there was to be no 'party,' his wooden face
relaxed into a faint but happy smile, and that
my feet ached to kick him.</p>

<p>That winter was what we called mild up
there, and it passed most uneventfully for
my tenants and for me. We saw very little
of each other since that chill to our friendship;<span class="pagenum">[161]</span>
but I soon began to find that the little
pale woman, who was too acid to excite as
much liking as she did pity and respect, had
no idea of allowing the obligations between
us to lie all on one side. Under the masculine
<i>r&eacute;gime</i> which had flourished in my
household before the irruption of Mrs.
Ellmer, her daughter and Janet, the art of
mending had been unknown and ignored,
and the science of cleaning my study had
been neglected. With regard to my own
raiment, the Brass Age, or age of pins,
succeeded the Bone Age, or age of buttons,
with unfailing regularity; and when, with
Janet, the Steel Age, or age of needles came
in, I sometimes thought I should prefer to
go back to primitive barbarism and holes in
my stockings rather than hobble about with
large lumps of worsted thread at the corners
of my toes,&mdash;which was the best result of a
process which the old lady called 'darning.'</p><p><span class="pagenum">[162]</span></p>

<p>The road to Ballater was for weeks impassable
with snowdrifts; no possibility of
replenishing one's wardrobe even from the
village's meagre resources. At last, being
by this time lamer than any pilgrim, I boldly
cut out the lumps in my stockings, and thereby
enlarged the holes. This flying in the
face of Providence must have been an awful
shock to Janet, for she related it to Mrs.
Ellmer with some acrimony; the result of
this was that the active little woman overhauled
my wardrobe, and everything else in
my house that was in need of repair by the
needle; she tried her hand successfully at
some amateur tailoring; she hunted out
some old curtains, and by a series of wonderful
processes, which she assured me were
very simple, transformed them from crumpled
rags into very handsome tapestry hangings
for a draughty corner of my study; she
carried off my old silver, piece by piece, and<span class="pagenum">[163]</span>
polished it up until, instead of wearing the
mouldy rusty hue of long neglect, it brightened
the whole room with its glistening
whiteness. I believe this last work was a
sacred pleasure to her; Babiole said her
mother cooed over the tankards and embraced
the punch-bowl. The way that woman
made old things look like new savoured of
sorcery to the obtuse male mind. Ferguson
would take each transfigured article, neatly
patched tablecloth, worn skin rug, combed
and cleaned to look like new, or whatever it
might be, and hold it at arm's length, squinting
horribly the while, and then, with a sigh
of dismay at the disappearance of the old
familiar rents, cast it from him in disgust.
The climax of his rage was reached when,
one evening at dinner, surprised by an unusually
savoury dish, I sent a message of congratulation
to Janet. Like a Northern
Mephistopheles, his eyes flashed fire.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[164]</span></p>

<p>'I didna know, sir, ye were so partial to
kickshaws,' he said haughtily, with the strong
Scotch accent into which, on his return to his
native hills, he had allowed himself to relapse.</p>

<p>I saw that I had made some fearful
blunder, and said no more; but I afterwards
learned from Babiole, as a great secret, that
her mother had prevailed upon Janet to
yield up her daily duties as cook as far as
my dinner was concerned; and my heart
began to melt and soften as the winter wore
on, towards the strictly anonymous little chef
who had delivered me from the binding
tyranny of haggis and cock-a-leekie.</p>

<p>When the snow melted away from all but
the tops of the hills, and there came fresh
little sprouts of pale green among the dark
feather foliage of the larches, a change came
over the tiny household of my tenants.
From early morning until the sun began
to sink low behind the hills Babiole was<span class="pagenum">[165]</span>
never to be found at the cottage. Sometimes,
indeed, she would dash in at midday
to dinner, as fresh and sweet as an opening
rose; but more often she would stay away
until evening began to creep on, taking with
her a most frugal meal of a couple of sandwiches
and a piece of shortbread. Even
that was shared with Ta-ta, whom I encouraged
to attend the venturesome little maiden
on her long rambles; the dog would follow
her now as willingly as she did me, and could
be fierce enough upon occasion to prove a
far from despicable bodyguard; while I
generally contrived to be about the grounds
somewhere when she started, and, having
noted the direction she took, I went that
way for my morning ride. Often I passed
them on the road, the girl walking at a sort
of dance, the dog leaping and springing
about her. At sight of me, Ta-ta would
rush to her master, barking with joy; then,<span class="pagenum">[166]</span>
seeing that I would not take the only sensible
course of allowing her to follow both her
favourites together, she would run from the
one to the other, in delirious perplexed
excitement, until by a few words and gestures
I let her know that her duty was with the
beauty and not the beast.</p>

<p>Sometimes I would see the two climbing
up a hill together, the collie not more sure-footed
than the child. Sometimes as I passed
there would be a great waving of handkerchief
and wagging of tail from some high
cairn, to show me triumphantly how much
more they dared than I, trotting on composedly
some hundreds of feet below. I was
always rather uneasy for the child, wandering
to these lonely heights and along such
unfrequented roads without any companion
but the dog; but her mother, with the odd
inconsistency which breaks out in the best of
us, could fear no danger to the girl from<span class="pagenum">[167]</span>
coarse peasant or steep cliff, while against
the wiles of the well-dressed she put her
strictly on her guard. As for the child herself,
I could only tell her to be careful of
her footing on rugged Craigendarroch, the
nearest, the prettiest, the most dangerous of
our higher hills: to tell her not to wander
whithersoever her fancy led her would have
been like warning a star not to mount so
high in the sky.</p>

<p>Then as evening fell and I began, like
any old woman, to grow anxious, I would
hear Ta-ta's tired step in the hall outside
my study, and a scratching at my door which
gave place to a piteous sniffing and whining
if I did not immediately rise to let her in.
Then with a gentle wag of the tail she would
trot up to the hearthrug and lie down, giving
a sideways glance at To-to, who would hop
down from his perch and make a grab at
her tail to punish her for gadding about, and,<span class="pagenum">[168]</span>
finding that appendage out of reach, would
sneak quietly back again and resume his
hunt for the flea who would never be caught,
to try to persuade us that his fruitless attempt
had been a mere inadvertency. How hard
Ta-ta would try, when a nice plate of gristle
and potato at dinner time had revived her
flagging energies, to describe to me the
events of the morning's walk! And how
the sound of a bright childish laugh from the
kitchen would stimulate her remembrance of
that jolly run up-hill! I knew, though I
said nothing, that Babiole used to come
across to find her mother, busy with my
dinner; and I could guess, from the altercations
I often heard, that the hungry girl
stole her share, and laughed at any one who
said her nay. The dining-room always grew
too hot when that bright laughter penetrated
to my ears, and I would say carelessly to
Ferguson<span class="pagenum">[169]</span>&mdash;</p>

<p>'You can leave the door open.'</p>

<p><i>He</i> knew, you may be sure, why I liked
to sit in a draught while March winds were
about; but the stern Scot, however much he
might still cherish enmity against the diabolical
cleverness of the mother, had had a
corner of his flinty heart pulverised by the
blooming child.</p>

<p>And so the cold spring passed into cool
summer, and I began to notice, little as I saw
of her, a change in the pretty maiden. As
the season advanced, her vivacity seemed to
subside a little, her dancing walk to give place
to a more sedate step, while her rambles were
often now limited to a climb up Craigendarroch,
which formerly would have been a
mere incident in the day's proceedings. I
remarked upon this to Mrs. Ellmer; for she
and I had now, in our loneliness, become
great chums.</p>

<p>'Oh, don't you know?' said she, with<span class="pagenum">[170]</span>
her grating little laugh, 'Babiole's in
love!'</p>

<p>'In love!' said I slowly. 'A child like
that!'</p>

<p>'Oh, it's not a first attachment by any
means,' said she, making merry over my surprise,
as she swung her little watering-pot
with one hand, and put her head on one side
to admire a row of handsome gladioluses
which she had reared with some care. 'Her
first, what you may call serious passion, was
at seven years old, two whole years later than
my earliest love. By the bye, Mr. Maude, I
really must beg you to let me make some cuttings
from your rose-trees; I have two excellent
briars here, and I flatter myself I can
graft as well as any gardener.'</p>

<p>'You can do everything, Mrs. Ellmer,'
said I gravely, with honest gratitude and
admiration. 'You can make cuttings from
every tree in the garden, if you please, and<span class="pagenum">[171]</span>
they will all hold their heads the higher for
it.'</p>

<p>The poor lady liked a little bit of simple
flattery, and indeed it by no means now seemed
out of place. The Highland air had brought
the pink colour back to her wan face, and
brightened her eyes, so that one now noticed
with admiration the extreme delicacy of her
features; while the rest and the relief from
worry had softened both her careworn expression
and the haggard outline of her face.
She now, with coquettish sprightliness, tapped
my shoulder and shook her head to show me
that she had no faith in my blandishments.</p>

<p>'Don't talk to me,' she said, but with a
smile which contradicted the prohibition;
'I'm too old for compliments, a woman with
a grown-up daughter!'</p>

<p>Now I was quite glad to go back to the
subject suggested by her last words.</p>

<p>'Who is the happy object of the young<span class="pagenum">[172]</span>
lady's preference?' I asked, trying to speak
in a tone of badinage, though indeed I thought
Babiole much too young and too pretty to
bestow even the most make-believe affection
on any one north o' Tweed, or south of it
either, for that matter.</p>

<p>'It's one of the young Duncans, at Fir
Lodge; the pretty-looking lad with the curly
fair hair.'</p>

<p>I gave a little 'hoch!' of disgust. A great
freckle-faced lout of a boy&mdash;I knew him! I
remembered, too, that the Duncans had joined
heartily in a scandalised murmur, far-off
sounds of which had reached my ears, at the
enormity of my bringing play-acting folk to
my Highland seraglio. With very few more
words I left Mrs. Ellmer, more put out than
I cared to show. However, after looking
angrily at the rhododendrons in the drive for
a little while, I happily remembered that the
annual visit of my four oddly-assorted friends<span class="pagenum">[173]</span>
was due within a month, and that then I
should have something more interesting to
occupy my mind than the flirtations of a couple
of children. 'And after that,' I said to myself,
'I think I shall set off on my wanderings
again for a little while, and the Ellmers can
remain here until they, too, are tired of it, and
so we shall avoid any wrench over the break-up.'
That the break-up must come I knew,
and, on the whole, I felt that it had better
come early than late&mdash;for me, at any rate.</p>

<p>I climbed up Craigendarroch next day,
and every day for a week after; I never met
any one, and every time I was alarmed by
the steepness of those rocks to the south,
where a poor young fellow who was out fern-hunting
fell down the perpendicular cliff one
summer's day, and was found a shapeless,
lifeless heap four days after on the side of the
hill. He was a stranger, and might have lain
there till his bones whitened on the rocks and<span class="pagenum">[174]</span>
ferns among the young oak-trees, if a couple
of Ballater lads had not stumbled upon his
body in their Sunday walk, and called out all
the village to see the sight. And these made
the most of the excitement in a singular way,
holding a highly decorous and Presbyterian
wake, settling themselves in a business-like
manner like a flock of crows on the broken
ground around the stone on which the dead
man, scarcely more silent and unconcerned
than they, held his mournful levee. This
incident had already given a tragic interest
to the south side of the pretty hill; and
although Babiole knew the place well, and
was as sure-footed and nimble as one of its
native squirrels, I felt anxious every day
when there was no answer to my call of
'Ta-ta! Ta-ta!' and was not satisfied until
I had made the circuit of the hill, pushed my
way through the barriers of uprooted firs with
which the gales of early spring had encumbered<span class="pagenum">[175]</span>
the hillside on the north, and going on
in that direction, came to the bare and almost
precipitous slope which forms the southern
wall of the Pass of Ballater.</p>

<p>On my eighth visit I heard a faint bark
from the ridge of hill to the north-west of the
pass; considering this as a clue, I made my
way down Craigendarroch, across the meadows
round Mona House, a white building of
simplest architecture, flanked by a garden
where straight rows of bright flowers looked
quaintly picturesque against a dark background
of fir and hill. Crossing the road
which ran at the foot of the ridge, I began
to climb. A rough steep path had here been
worn among the bracken, and was widened
at every ascent by falls of loose soil and
stones. I knew what a pretty little nook
there was at the top, just the place where a
lovelorn maid would delight to make a nest.
The path grew steeper than ever towards the<span class="pagenum">[176]</span>
top, and led suddenly to a grassy hollow, one
wall of which was a perpendicular gray cliff,
broken by narrow and inaccessible ridges on
which slender little birch-trees contrived to
grow. On the opposite side the mossy
ground sloped gently, and the wild rabbits
scurried about among the stumps of fallen
pines.</p>

<p>I had only gone a few steps along the soft
ground when I caught the sound of a light
girlish voice; it came from the miniature
chasm at the foot of the cliff. I wondered
who the child was talking to. But as I came
nearer, hearing no voice but hers, I supposed
she must be reading aloud.</p>

<p>'Oh no, Roderick,' at last I was close
enough to hear, 'I love you passionately, with
the love one knows but once. But it is impossible
for me to do as you wish. You
speak to me of your father; you urge upon
me that he would forgive my lowly birth, that<span class="pagenum">[177]</span>
he would welcome to his ancestral halls the
woman of your choice, whoever she might
be. But do not forget that I too have pride,
that I too have a duty to perform to my
parents.' Then came a change of tone, and
a sort of practical parenthesis, hurried through
quickly like a stage direction: 'I don't mean
my father of course, because he was so clever
that he had to think of his art and wasn't like
a father at all.' Then her tone became sentimental
again: 'But my mother&mdash;mamma is
worthy to have all the wealth of kings
showered at her feet. She is beautiful, and
clever, and good; Mr. Maude&mdash;indeed everybody,
admires and loves her. No, Roderick,
I will not allow my mother to become a mere
mother-in-law.'</p>

<p>The bathos of the conclusion upset my
gravity; I came close to the edge of the pit
and looked down. The little maid was not
<span class="pagenum">[178]</span>reading, but was sitting by herself on a tree-trunk
among the stones, with the dog asleep
on the edge of her frock, living in a world of
her own, and holding converse with the people
there. I crept away as quietly as I could and
went back home in an amused but rather rapturous
state: the next time I saw my goddess,
though, she was devouring slice after slice of
bread and jam with prosaic ravenousness at
the kitchen door.</p>

<p>And I concluded that at fourteen, even
with a face like a flower and a voice like a
bird's, 'the love one knows but once' and
perfect peace of mind are not incompatible
things.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p>It was Fabian Scott who, being by his profession
less of a free agent than any other
member of my little circle of friends, fixed the
date of their yearly visit. As soon as he made
known to me the first day when he would be
free, I summoned the rest, and not one of
them had ever yet failed me. Fabian wrote
to me this year, giving the fifteenth of
August as the day on which the closing of
the theatre at which he was playing would
leave him free.</p>

<p>The news of the expected arrivals quickly
reached the ears of Mrs. Ellmer, who came
skipping along the garden towards me one<span class="pagenum">[180]</span>
morning about a week before the visit, and
attacked me at once with much vivacity.</p>

<p>'Aha!' she began, 'and so we were to be
left in ignorance of the gay doings, were
we?'</p>

<p>'If you allude to the meeting of half a
dozen old fogeys on the fifteenth, Mrs.
Ellmer, I assure you I was coming to the
cottage to tell you about it. But we shall
be about as sportive as a gathering of the
British Arch&aelig;ological Association, and as we
shall be out on the moors all day, I am afraid
you won't find the place much livelier than
usual. I think,' I added, coming to the pith
of the matter with some feeling of awkwardness,
'that you had better keep Miss Babiole
more&mdash;more with you, while&mdash;while the
gentlemen are here. Or&mdash;or if you would
like a trip to the seaside we might see about
a couple of weeks at Muchalls or Stonehaven,
<span class="pagenum">[181]</span>and that would give us an opportunity of&mdash;of
having the cottage whitewashed, you
know,' I finished up, with a sudden gleam of
tardy inventive genius.</p>

<p>The fact was, I had begun to tingle at the
thought of the merciless 'chaff'&mdash;as much
worse to bear than slander as the stigma
of fool is than that of rogue&mdash;which the
importation of my fair tenants would bring
down upon me. Besides, though my four
visitors were all old friends, and very good
fellows, yet a pretty face may work such
Circe-like wonders, even in the best of us,
that I thought it better that our bachelor
loneliness should be, as before, untempered
by the smiles of any woman lovelier than
Janet. But Mrs. Ellmer, at my hesitating
suggestion, grew rigid and haughty.</p>

<p>'Of course, Mr. Maude,' she said, 'if you
wish now to make use of the cottage my
daughter and I have done our best to keep
in order for you, we shall be ready to pack<span class="pagenum">[182]</span>
up at any time. We can go to-morrow, if
you like. I have no doubt that I shall be
able to find an opening for the autumn
season with some company.'</p>

<p>'No, no, no!' interrupted I emphatically
and with some impatience, 'Pray do not
think of such a thing. There is plenty of
room in my own place for all my friends.
My sole object in making the suggestion I
did was to prevent your being pestered with
the attentions of a lot of rough sportsmen,
who, when they were tired of shooting, would
find nothing better to do than to worry you
and Miss Babiole to death. And you remember,'
I ended, as a happy thought, 'how, when
you came here, you insisted on privacy.'</p>

<p>'One may have too much even of such a
good thing as one's own society,' said she,
with an affected little laugh. 'I think I could
bear a little attention now, with much equanimity,
even from a sportsman who "could<span class="pagenum">[183]</span>
find nothing better to do." Of course, I
could expect no more than that from gentlemen
of such rank as your guests,' she added,
rather venomously. 'But for a change even
that might be acceptable.'</p>

<p>Good heavens! The woman would not
understand me.</p>

<p>'But Babiole!' I suggested quietly.</p>

<p>'Babiole is only a child; but even if she
were not, a daughter of mine would be
perfectly able to take care of herself, Mr.
Maude.'</p>

<p>After this snub, I could only bow and
take myself off, spending the interval before
my guests' arrival in schooling myself for the
approaching ordeal.</p>

<p>The first to arrive on the fifteenth were
Lord Edgar Normanton and Mr. Richard
Fussell, the latter, anxious to make the most
of his annual taste of rank and fashion,
having lain in wait for the former at King's<span class="pagenum">[184]</span>
Cross, and insisted on bearing him company
during the entire journey. I met them at
Ballater station at 2.15 in the afternoon, and
was sorry to hear from Edgar, who never
looked otherwise than the picture of robust
health, and who was, moreover, getting fat,
that he was far from well.</p>

<p>'I tell his lordship that he should take
rowing exercise. Nothing like a good pull
every day on the river to keep a man in
condition,' urged Mr. Fussell, who was fifty
inches round what had once been his waist,
and who seemed to radiate health and
happiness.</p>

<p>They informed me that Fabian Scott had
also travelled up by the night mail, but in
another compartment; so I went to meet
the train, which came into Ballater at 5.50,
and found both Fabian and Mr. Maurice
Browne disputing so violently that they had
forgotten to get out. Fabian had indeed<span class="pagenum">[185]</span>
taken advantage of the stopping of the train
to stride up and down the confined area of
the railway carriage, gesticulating violently
with his hatbox, rug, gun, and various other
unconsidered trifles. I guessed that they
could only have travelled together from
Aberdeen, for there had been no bloodshed.
They had been having a little discussion
on realism in art, of which Maurice Browne
was an ardent disciple. They were still hard
at it, in terms unfit for publication, when I
mounted the step and put my head in at the
window. Excitable Fabian, with his keen
eyes still flashing indignation with 'exotic
filth,' shook my hand till he brought on
partial paralysis of that member, while he
fired a last shot into his less erratic opponent.</p>

<p>'No, sir,' he protested vehemently, 'I
deny neither your ability nor your good faith,
nor those of your French master; but I have
the same objection to the fictions of your<span class="pagenum">[186]</span>
school, as works of art, as I should have to
the performance of a play written by cripples
for cripples. It would be a curiosity, sir, and
might attract crowds of morbid-minded
people, besides cripples; but it would be
none the less a disgusting and degraded
exhibition, antagonistic to nature and truth,
to which the feeblest "virtue victorious and
vice vanquished" melodrama would be as day
unto night. With minds attuned to low
thoughts, you seek for low things, and
degrade them still further by your treatment.
You have a philosophy, I admit, sir, but it is
the philosophy of the hog.'</p>

<p>And, having poured out this persuasive
little harangue with such volubility that not
even an Irishman could get in a word edgeways,
Fabian allowed himself to be enticed
on to the platform, and began asking me
questions about myself with childlike affection.
Maurice Browne followed, somewhat<span class="pagenum">[187]</span>
refreshed by this torrent of abuse, since the
aim of his literary ambition was rather to
scandalise than to convince. He was tall,
thin, and unhealthy-looking, with a pallid
face and pink-rimmed eyes, and an appearance
altogether unfortunate in the propagator
of a new cult. I believe he was, on the
whole, fonder of me than Fabian was. My
disastrous ugliness appealed to his distaste
for the beautiful, and having once, as a complete
stranger, very generously come to my
aid in a difficulty, he felt ever after the
natural and kindly human liking for a fellow-creature
who has given one an opportunity
of posing as the deputy of God. These two
gentlemen, with their strong and aggressive
opinions, formed the disturbing element in
our yearly meeting, and, each being always
at deadly feud with somebody else, might be
reckoned on to keep the fun alive. Both
talked to me, and me alone, on our way to<span class="pagenum">[188]</span>
the house, with such sly hits at one another
as their wit or their malice could suggest.
Fabian raved about the effects of descending
sun on heather and pine-covered hills,
Maurice Browne bemoaned the stony poverty
of the cottages, and opined that constant intermarriages
between the inhabitants had
reduced the scanty population to idiots.
Then Fabian told me how many inquiries
had been made about me by old acquaintances,
who still hoped I would some day
return from the wilds, and Maurice instantly
tempered my satisfaction by asking me if I
had heard that the Earl of Saxmundham
was going to divorce his wife. The question
gave me a great shock, not so much on
account of the blow it dealt at an old idol
still conventionally enthroned in my memory
as the last love of my life, as because I knew
how much distress such a report must cause
to poor old Edgar.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[189]</span></p>

<p>I was quite relieved, on entering the
drive, to meet my stalwart friend and his
faithful companion, both very merry over
some joke which had already made Mr.
Fussell purple in the face. On seeing us
they burst out laughing afresh. I guessed
what the joke was.</p>

<p>'Deuced lonely up here, isn't it?' said
Mr. Fussell to me. 'No society, nothing
but books, books,&mdash;except for one short
fortnight in the year. Eh, Maude?'</p>

<p>'Eh? eh? what's this?' said Fabian.</p>

<p>'His only books are woman's looks, and
I wonder they didn't teach him the folly of
bringing a band of gay and dashing cavaliers
to read them too,' said Edgar.</p>

<p>Fabian turned slowly round to me, with a
look of extreme pain, and shook his head
mournfully.</p>

<p>'Oh, what a tangled web we weave,' he
murmured sorrowfully, and then began to<span class="pagenum">[190]</span>
dance the Highland fling, with his rug
tartanwise over his shoulder.</p>

<p>Maurice Browne gravely cocked his hat,
pulled down his cuffs, buttoned up his coat,
and requesting Edgar to carry his bag,
proceeded up the drive with his hands in
his pockets, whistling.</p>

<p>In fact the whole quartett had given
themselves up to ribald gaiety at my expense,
and my explanation that I had merely given
a poor lady and her daughter shelter for the
winter in an unused cottage only provoked
another explosion. It was understood that
at these bachelor meetings all rules of social
decorum should be scrupulously violated, so
there was nothing for it but to join in the
mirth with the best grace I could.</p>

<p>'You know who it is,' I said, half aside,
to Fabian, hoping to turn him at least into an
ally. 'It's poor little Mrs. Ellmer, the wife
of that drunken painter.'</p><p><span class="pagenum">[191]</span></p>

<p>But Fabian was flinty. Turning towards
the rest, with his expiring Romeo expression,
he wailed: 'Oh, gentlemen, he is adding
insult to injury; he is loading with abuse the
bereaved husband of this lady to whom he
has given shelter for the winter!'</p>

<p>'Which winter? How much winter?'
asked the others.</p>

<p>The more they saw that I was getting
really pained by their chaff the worse it
became, until Fabian, stalking gravely up
to Ferguson, who stood on the doorstep,
pointed tragically in the direction of nowhere
in particular, and said, in a sepulchral voice&mdash;</p>

<p>'You are a Scotchman, so am I. I have
been pained by stories of orgies, debaucheries,
and general goings on in this neighbourhood.
Tell me, on your word as a fellow-countryman,
can these gentlemen and myself, as
churchwardens and Sunday-school teachers,
enter this house without loss of self-respect?'</p><p><span class="pagenum">[192]</span></p>

<p>'I dinna ken aboot self-respect, gentlemen;
but if you don't come in, ye'll stand
the loss of a varra good dinner,' answered
Ferguson, with a welcoming twinkle in
his eyes.</p>

<p>'I am satisfied,' said Fabian, entering
precipitately.</p>

<p>And the rest followed without scruple.</p>

<p>At dinner, to my relief, they found other
subjects for their tongues to wag upon; for
Maurice Browne, never being satisfied long
with any topic but literary 'shop,' brought
realism up again, and there ensued a triangular
battle. For Edgar, who, now that
he had passed the age and weight for
cricket, had grown distressingly intellectual,
was an ardent admirer of the modern
American school of fiction in which nothing
ever happens, and in which nobody is anything
in particular for long at a time. He
hungrily devoured all the works of that<span class="pagenum">[193]</span>
desperately clever gentleman who maintains
that 'a woman standing by a table is an
incident,' and looked down from an eminence
of six feet two of unqualified disdain on the
'battle, murder, and sudden death' school on
the one hand, and on the 'all uncleanness'
school on the other. Not at all crushed by
his scorn, Fabian retorted by calling the
American school the 'School of Foolish
Talking,' and the battle raged till long past
sundown, Mr. Fussell and I watching the
case on behalf of the general reader, and
passing the decanters till the various schools
all became 'mixed schools.'</p>

<p>At this point a diversion was created by
a fleeting view caught through the door by
Fabian, of Janet carrying dishes away to
the kitchen. He heaved a sigh of relief,
and, with upturned eyes, breathed gently,
'I would trust him another winter!'</p>

<p>I had bought a piano at Aberdeen, as<span class="pagenum">[194]</span>
Fabian had spread a report that he could
play, while all my guests nursed themselves
in the belief that they could sing. The
instrument had been placed in a corner of
my study against the wall. But the Philistinism
of this so shocked Fabian that he
instantly directed its removal into the middle
of the room. This necessitated a re-disposal
of most of the furniture. The centre table
was piled high with my private papers.
Fabian looked hastily through these, and,
observing, 'I don't see anything here we
need keep,' tumbled them all into the grate
where the fire, indispensable as evening
draws on in the Highlands, was burning.
Mechanically, I saved what I could, while
Fabian's subversive orders were being
carried out round me. After a few minutes'
hard work, all my favourite objects were out
of sight. Maurice Browne was reclining
comfortably in my own particular chair, and<span class="pagenum">[195]</span>
most of the rest of the seats having been
turned out into the hall as taking up too
much room, I had to sit upon To-to's kennel.
The curtains were also pulled down in
deference to a suggestion of Browne's that
they interfered with the full sound of the
voice, but I wished they had been left up
when the caterwauling began.</p>

<p>Mr. Fussell led off with 'The Stirrup
Cup,' in deference to his being the eldest of
the party, and also to purchase his non-intervention
when the other performers
should begin. It was some time before he
got a fair start, being afflicted with hoarseness,
which he attributed to the Highland
air, and the rest unanimously to the Highland
whiskey. When at last he warmed to his
work, however, and said complacently that
he was 'all right' now, they must have heard
him at Aberdeen. He had a good baritone
voice, the value of which was discounted by<span class="pagenum">[196]</span>
his total ignorance of the art of singing, his
imperfect acquaintance with both the time
and the words of his songs, and his belief
that the louder one shouted the better one
sang. When at last, crimson and panting,
but proud of himself, he sat down amid the
astonished comments of the company on the
strength of the roof, Maurice Browne wailed
forth in a cracked voice a rollicking Irish
song to the accompaniment of 'Auld Robin
Gray'; Fabian followed with no voice at all,
but no end of expression, in a pathetic lovesong
of his own composition, during which
everybody went to look for some cigars he
had in his overcoat pocket. I refused altogether
to perform, and nobody pressed me;
but I had my revenge. When Edgar, strung
up to do or die, asked Fabian to accompany
him with 'The Death of Nelson,' and rose
with the modest belief that he should astonish
them with a very fine bass, the first note was<span class="pagenum">[197]</span>
a deep-mouthed roar that broke down the
last twig of our forbearance, and we all rose
as one man and declared that we had had
music enough. Poor Ta-ta, who had been
turned out of the room at the beginning
of the concert for emulating the first singer
by a prolonged howl, was let in again,
and relief having been given to everybody's
artistic yearnings, we ended the evening
with smoke and peace.</p>

<p>Next morning we were all early on the
moors, where we distinguished ourselves in
various ways. Fabian, who worked himself
into a fearful state of excitement over the
sport, shot much and often, but brought
home nothing at all, and thanked Heaven,
when calmness returned with the evening
hours, for keeping his fellow-creatures out
of the range of his wild gun. Maurice
Browne made a good mixed bag of a hedgehog,
a pee-wit, and a keeper's leg, and then<span class="pagenum">[198]</span>
complained that shooting was monotonous
work. Edgar worked hard and gravely, but
was so slow that for the most part the grouse
were out of sight before he fired. Mr.
Fussell did better, and attributed every
failure to bring down his bird to his 'd&mdash;&mdash;d
glasses,' upon which Fabian hastened to ask
him if he meant the glasses of the night
before.</p>

<p>However, everybody but the keeper who
was shot, declared himself delighted with the
day's sport; but on the following morning
Fabian and Maurice Browne seceded from
the party and amused themselves, the former
by sketching, the latter by learning by heart,
by means of chats with ostlers and shopkeepers,
the <i>chronique scandaleuse</i> of the
neighbourhood; in the evening he triumphantly
informed me that the morals of the
lowest haunts in Paris were immaculate,
compared to those of my simple Highland<span class="pagenum">[199]</span>
village. I am afraid this startling revelation
had less effect upon me than a little incident
which I witnessed next day.</p>

<p>I had been congratulating myself upon
the fact that, though all my visitors vied
with each other in attentions to Mrs. Ellmer,
who had become, under the influence of this
sudden rush of admirers, gayer and giddier
than ever, they looked upon Babiole, as her
mother had prophesied, merely as a little
girl and of no account. But on the morning
referred to, I came upon Fabian and the
child together in my garden at the foot of
the hill. He was fastening some roses in
the front of her blue cotton frock, and when
he had done so, and stepped back a few
paces to admire the effect, he claimed a kiss
as a reward for his trouble. She gave it
him shyly but simply. She was only a child,
of course, and his little sweetheart of six
years ago; and the blush that rose in her<span class="pagenum">[200]</span>
cheeks when she caught sight of me was no
sign of self-consciousness, for her colour came
and went at the faintest emotion of surprise
or pleasure. As for Fabian, he drew her
hand through his arm, and came skipping
towards me like a stage peasant.</p>

<p>'We're going to be married, Babiole and
I, as soon as we've saved up money enough,'
said he.</p>

<p>And the child laughed, delighted with this
extravagant pleasantry.</p>

<p>But, though I laughed too, I didn't see
any fun in it at all; for the remembrance
that the time would come when this little
blossom of youth and happiness and all
things fresh and sweet would be plucked
from the hillside, was not in the least amusing
to me. And when this young artist proceeded
to devote his mornings to long
rambles with 'the child,' and his afternoons
to making sketches of 'the child,' I thought<span class="pagenum">[201]</span>
his attentions would be much better bestowed
on a grown-up person. But as Mrs. Ellmer
saw nothing to censure in all this I could not
interfere. It spoilt my yearly holiday for
me, though, in an unaccountable fashion; and
when at the end of a fortnight my guests
went away, no regrets that I felt at their
departure were so keen as my ridiculous
annoyance on seeing that Fabian's farewell
kiss to his little sweetheart left the child in
tears.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</h2>

<p>With the departure of my summer visitors,
a gloom fell upon us all at Larkhall. Mrs.
Ellmer missed her admirers and grew petulant;
Babiole had discovered some new
haunt and was never to be found; while I
felt the wanderer's fever growing strong
upon me again. Fabian Scott had cleared
up the little mystery concerning the husband
and father of my tenants. It appeared that
Mr. Ellmer, while neglecting and ill-using
his wife without scruple when she was under
the same roof with him, was subject to strong
fits of conjugal devotion when two or three
months of hard work, away from him, gave<span class="pagenum">[203]</span>
him reason to think that she would be in
possession of a few pounds of carefully-gleaned
savings, while he, her lawful and
once adored husband, did not know where
to turn for a glass of beer. During the
winter before I found them in Aberdeen
some friends with whom both mother and
child had taken refuge from his drunken fury
had had to pay him a heavy ransom for their
kindness, besides exposing themselves to the
inconvenience of having their house mobbed
and their windows broken whenever the
tender husband and father, having exhausted
the tribute paid to keep him in the public-house,
bethought himself of this new way of
calling attention to his wrongs.</p>

<p>Fabian told me that a few weeks back he
had been accosted in the Strand by Mr.
Ellmer, who was looking more tattered and
dissipated than ever. This gentleman had
experienced great concern at the total disappearance<span class="pagenum">[204]</span>
of his wife, had asked Fabian's
advice as to the best means of finding her,
and had finally let out his conviction that
she was 'doing well for herself,' in a tone of
bitter indignation. Fabian had said nothing
of this meeting to Mrs. Ellmer, being, both
for her sake and for mine, anxious not to
touch those strings of sentiment which, in
the better kind of women, sound so readily
for the most good-for-nothing of husbands.</p>

<p>Already Mrs. Ellmer had begun to allude
with irritating frequency to the talents and
noble qualities of her 'poor husband,' whom
it was the fashion among us all to consider
as the 'victim of art,' as if art had been a
chronic disease. This fiction had gone on
expanding and developing until the illustrious
artist, to whom absence was so becoming,
had eclipsed the entire Royal Academy,
and had become to his wife a source of
legitimate pride which, if touching by its<span class="pagenum">[205]</span>
na&iuml;vet&eacute;, was also wearisome by its excess.</p>

<p>Between proud reminiscences of her husband
and happy memories of her late flirtations
with Mr. Fussell and Mr. Browne,
Mrs. Ellmer was rather disposed to treat me
and my modest friendship as of small account.
So the worm turned at last, by which I
mean that I spent my days deer-stalking,
grouse-shooting, and salmon-fishing, and my
evenings with To-to, Ta-ta, and my books.
This estrangement helped me to make up
my mind to leave Larkhall for Italy before
the winter came on, and a sharp frost in the
last days of October sent me off to Aberdeen
to make inquiries about my proposed journey.
I would install Mrs. Ellmer and her daughter
at the Hall, if they cared to remain, so that,
at any rate, they would be housed out of
harm's&mdash;that is, Mr. Ellmer's&mdash;way for the
winter.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[206]</span></p>

<p>Janet had particularly entreated me to be
back early, as there had been ghostly noises
of late in the region of the drawing-room;
and though her braw laddie, John, was ample
protection against bodily intruders, yet, in the
case of wraiths, though I only rented the
place, and therefore could have no family influence
with the spirits of departed owners, I
was likely, through my superior social standing,
to get a better hearing from the phantoms
of gentlefolk than the staunchest man-servant
could hope to do.</p>

<p>It was past six, and already dark, when I
came back and went into the study, attracted
by sounds of a very elementary performance
on the piano. But there was perfect silence
as I entered, and no human creature to be
seen. Ta-ta, however, was hovering about
near the piano, now replaced in its original
position in a corner against the wall. I
suspected the identity of the musical ghost, and<span class="pagenum">[207]</span>
quietly seated myself by the fireplace to see
what would happen. First, Ta-ta ran excitedly
backwards and forwards between me
and the other side of the table; then slight
sounds as of stealthy creeping feet and hands
were followed by a fleeting apparition of a
female figure on all fours between the table
and the screen.</p>

<p>'What are you running away for?' I asked,
very gently.</p>

<p>Babiole was so much startled by the voice
that she reappeared involuntarily, on her feet
this time, from behind the screen.</p>

<p>'I beg your pardon, Mr. Maude, indeed
I'm very sorry,' she began, 'I didn't think
you would be in so soon.'</p>

<p>'And what have I done that you should
be so sorry to see me?'</p>

<p>'Oh no, I didn't mean that. I'm not
sorry to see you, I'm always glad to, only we
never do now, you know, and I thought<span class="pagenum">[208]</span>
perhaps you would be angry at my coming
into your study,' said she, recovering confidence,
as she saw that I was not displeased.</p>

<p>'Oh, so you took advantage of my being
away to do what you thought I should not
like?'</p>

<p>I spoke playfully, but Babiole hung her head.</p>

<p>'Well, what have you got to say for yourself?'</p>

<p>After a few moments' silence she raised her
head, staring before her with the fixed and
desperate earnestness of a sensitive young
creature who thinks the slightest blame a
terrible thing to bear.</p>

<p>'I don't believe it was so very wrong,'
she said at last. 'I was so very careful; I
took off my boots that I had been out on the
hills in, and put on clean shoes, not to hurt
the carpet; and I just put down the notes so
lightly I could not have hurt the piano, and I
washed my hands before touching the books.'</p><p><span class="pagenum">[209]</span></p>

<p>'The books! What books have you been
touching?'</p>

<p>'Oh, I took down several; but I couldn't
read all, because they were not English.'</p>

<p>This was satisfactory as far as it went;
but then the best English authors are considered
scarcely more suitable reading for
'the young person' than the worst French
ones.</p>

<p>'And which do you like best of the English
ones?'</p>

<p>'I like one I found yesterday, all letters
from different people, with the s's like f's.'</p>

<p>I poked the fire into a blaze, and led the
girl back to the book-shelves.</p>

<p>'Now, show me which one you mean.'</p>

<p>She hesitated, and looked at me, at first
suspecting some trap. As I waited quietly,
she at last timidly touched a volume of <i>The
Tattler</i>. I pointed to a modern 'popular
novel,' with a picture-cover and popular<span class="pagenum">[210]</span>
title, which was among the lumber of the
shelves.</p>

<p>'Have you read that?'</p>

<p>'Yes,' indifferently.</p>

<p>'Didn't you like that better than <i>The
Tattler</i>?'</p>

<p>'Oh no!' indignantly.</p>

<p>'Why not? It is all about an actress.'</p>

<p>'An actress!' contemptuously. 'It isn't
like any of the actresses I've ever met. It's
a silly book.'</p>

<p>'Is there any other book you like?'</p>

<p>'Oh yes. I like these.' She passed her
hand lovingly over a row&mdash;not an unbroken
row, of course&mdash;of solid-looking calf-bound
volumes, full of old-fashioned line engravings
of British scenery, the text containing a
discursive account of the places illustrated,
enlivened by much historical information,
apocryphal anecdote, and old-world scandal.
'And <i>Jane Eyre</i>, and this.' 'This' was an<span class="pagenum">[211]</span>
illustrated translation of <i>Don Quixote</i>. 'Oh,
and I like <i>Clarissa Harlowe</i> and that book
with the red cover.'</p>

<p>'<i>Ivanhoe?</i>'</p>

<p>'Oh yes, <i>Ivanhoe</i>,' she repeated carefully
after me. Evidently, as in the case of <i>Don
Quixote</i>, she had been uncertain how to pronounce
the title.</p>

<p>'And these?' I pointed, one by one, to
some modern novels. 'Don't you like any
of these?' Already I began to be alarmed
at the extent of her reading.</p>

<p>'Yes, I like some of them&mdash;pretty well.'</p>

<p>'Why do you like <i>Don Quixote</i> and <i>Ivanhoe</i>
better?'</p>

<p>She considered for a long time, her blue
eyes fixed thoughtfully on the shelves.</p>

<p>'I think I feel more as if they'd really
happened.'</p>

<p>'But when you were reading <i>Armadale</i>,
didn't you feel as if that had happened?'</p><p><span class="pagenum">[212]</span></p>

<p>'Oh yes,' with a flash of excitement.
'One night I couldn't sleep, because I thought
of it so much.'</p>

<p>'Then you thought as much about it as
about <i>Ivanhoe</i>?'</p>

<p>'Ye-es, but&mdash;&mdash;' A pause. 'I thought
about <i>Ivanhoe</i> because I wanted to, and I
thought about <i>Armadale</i> because I couldn't
help it.'</p>

<p>I went on asking her what she had read,
and I own that I dare not give the list. But
her frank young mind had absorbed no evil,
and when I asked her how she liked one
famous peccant hero, she answered quite
simply&mdash;</p>

<p>'I liked him very much&mdash;part of the book.
And when he did wrong things, I was always
wanting to go to him, and tell him not to be
so wicked and silly; and then, oh! I was so
glad when he reformed and married Sophia.'</p>

<p>'But he wasn't good enough for her.'</p><p><span class="pagenum">[213]</span></p>

<p>'Ah, but then he was a man!' Her tone
implied '<i>only</i> a man.'</p>

<p>'Then you think women are better than
men?'</p>

<p>'I think they ought to be.'</p>

<p>'Why?'</p>

<p>'Well, men have to work, and women
have only to be good.'</p>

<p>I was surprised at this answer.</p>

<p>'That is not true always. Your mother
is a very good woman, and has had to work
very hard indeed.'</p>

<p>'But mamma's an exception; she says so.
And she says it's very hard to work as she
does, and be good too.'</p>

<p>I could scarcely help laughing, though it
was pretty to see how innocently the young
girl had taken the querulous speech.</p>

<p>'Well, and then I'm a man, and I don't
have to work.'</p>

<p>'Perhaps that's why you're so good.'</p><p><span class="pagenum">[214]</span></p>

<p>I was so utterly astonished at this na&iuml;ve
speech that I had nothing to say. The blood
rushed to the girl's face; she was afraid she
had been rude.</p>

<p>'How do you know that I am good,
Babiole?' I asked gently.</p>

<p>But this was taxing her penetration too
much.</p>

<p>'I don't know,' she answered shyly.</p>

<p>'Why do you think people are better when
they don't work?'</p>

<p>She looked at me, and was reassured that
I was not offended.</p>

<p>'Well, sometimes when mamma has been
working very hard&mdash;not now, you know; but
it used to be like that&mdash;she used to say things
that hurt me, and made me want to cry. And
then I used to look at her poor tired face and
say to myself, "It's the hard work and not
mamma that says those things;" and then,
of course, I did not mind. And when<span class="pagenum">[215]</span>
you have once had to work too hard, you
never get over it as you do over other
things.'</p>

<p>'What other things?'</p>

<p>'Oh&mdash;fancies and&mdash;and things like that.'</p>

<p>'Love troubles?'</p>

<p>She looked up at me with a shy, sideways
glance that was full of the most perfectly unconscious
witchery.</p>

<p>'Yes, mamma says they're nonsense.'</p>

<p>'She liked nonsense, too, once.'</p>

<p>Babiole looked up at me with the delight
of a common perception.</p>

<p>'Yes, I've often thought that. And then
all men are not like&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>She stopped short.</p>

<p>'Papa?'</p>

<p>She shook her head. 'One mustn't say
that. One must make allowances for clever
people, mamma says.'</p>

<p>'You will be clever, too, some day, if you<span class="pagenum">[216]</span>
go on reading and thinking about what you
read.'</p>

<p>'No, I don't want to be clever; it makes
people so selfish. But,' with a sigh, 'I wish
I knew something, and could play and sing
and read all those books that are not
English.'</p>

<p>'Shall I teach you French?'</p>

<p>'Will you? Oh, Mr. Maude!'</p>

<p>I think she was going to clap her hands
with delight, but remembered in time the
impropriety of such a proceeding. Four
o'clock next day was fixed as the hour for
the first lesson, and in the meantime I made
another journey to Aberdeen to provide
myself with a whole library of French
grammars and other elementary works.</p>

<p>At four o'clock Babiole made her appearance,
very scrupulously combed and washed,
and wearing the air of intense seriousness
befitting such a matter as the beginning of<span class="pagenum">[217]</span>
one's education. This almost broke down,
however, under the glowing excitement of
taking a phrase-book into one's hand, and
repeating after me, 'Good-day, <i>bon-jour</i>;
How do you do? <i>Comment vous portezvous?</i>'
and a couple of pages of the same
kind. Then she wrote out the verb 'To
have' in French and English; and her
appetite for knowledge not being yet
quenched, she then learnt and wrote down
the names of different objects round us, some
of which, I regret to say, her master had to
find out in the dictionary, not being prepared
to give off-hand the French for 'hearthrug,'
letter-weight,' and 'wainscoting.' We then
went through the names of the months and
the seasons of the year, after which, surfeited
with information, she gave a little sigh of
completed bliss, and, looking up at me, said
simply that she thought that was as much as
she could learn perfectly by to-morrow. I<span class="pagenum">[218]</span>
thought it was a great deal more, but did not
like to discourage her by saying so. I had
much doubt about my teaching, having been
plunged into it suddenly without having had
time to formulate a method; but then I was
convinced that by the time I felt more sure
of my powers my pupil's zeal would have
melted away, and I should have no one to
experimentalise upon. As soon as I had
assured her that she had done quite enough
for the first lesson, Babiole rose, collected
the formidable pile of books, her exercise-book,
and the pen I had consecrated to her
use, and asked me where she should keep
them. We decided upon a corner of the
piano as being a place where they would not
be in my way, Babiole having a charmingly
feminine reverence for the importance of
even the most frivolous occupations of the
stronger sex. After this she thanked me
very gravely and prettily for my kindness in<span class="pagenum">[219]</span>
teaching her, and hastened away, evidently
in the innocent belief that I must be anxious
to be alone.</p>

<p>What a light the bright child seemed to
have left in the musty room! I began to
smile to myself at the remembrance of her
preternatural gravity, and Ta-ta put her forepaws
on my knees and wagged her tail for
sympathy. I thought it very probable that
Mrs. Ellmer would interfere to prevent the
girl's coming again, or that Babiole's enthusiasm
for learning would die out in a day or
two, and I should be left waiting for my
pupil with my grammars and dictionaries on
my hands.</p>

<p>However, she reappeared next day,
absolutely perfect in the verb <i>avoir</i>, the
months, the seasons, and the pages out of
the phrase-book. When I praised her she
said, with much warmth&mdash;</p>

<p>'I could have learnt twice as many<span class="pagenum">[220]</span>
phrases if I'd known how to pronounce
them!'</p>

<p>In fact, beginning to learn at an age when
she was able to understand, and impelled by
a strong sense of her own deficiencies, she
learnt so fast and so well that her education
soon became the strongest interest of my life,
and when my fear that she would tire had
worn away, I gave whole hours to considering
what I should teach her, and to preparing
myself for her lessons. As winter drew on,
the darkening days gave us both the excuse
we wanted for longer working hours. From
three to half-past six we now sat together
in the study, reading, writing, translating.
When I found her willing I had added Latin
to her studies, and we diligently plodded
through a course of reading arbitrarily
marked out by me, and followed by my pupil
with enthusiastic docility.</p>

<p>All thoughts of leaving Ballater for the<span class="pagenum">[221]</span>
winter had now disappeared from my mind.
I was happier in my new occupation than I
remembered to have been before, and as I
saw spring approaching, I regretted the short
days, which had been brighter to me than
midsummer.</p>

<p>'I mustn't keep you indoors so long now,
Babiole,' I said to her one afternoon in the
first days of April. 'I have been making
you work too hard lately, and you must go
and get back your roses on the hills.'</p>

<p>I saw the light come over the girl's face
as she looked out of the window, and, with a
pang of self-reproach, I felt that, in spite of
herself, the earnest little student had been
waiting eagerly for some such words as
these.</p>

<p>'O&mdash;h&mdash;h,' she whispered, in a long-drawn
breath of pleasure, 'it must be lovely up
among the pine-woods now!'</p>

<p>I said nothing, and she turned round to<span class="pagenum">[222]</span>
me with a mistrustful inquiring face. I went
on looking over an exercise she had written,
as if absorbed in that occupation. But the
little one's perceptions were too keen for me.
She was down on her knees on the floor
beside my chair in a moment, with a most
downcast face, her eyes full of tears.</p>

<p>'Oh, Mr. Maude, what an ungrateful little
wretch you must think me!'</p>

<p>I was so much moved that I could not
take her pretty apology quietly. I burst out
into a shout of laughter.</p>

<p>'Why, Babiole, you must think me an
ogre! You don't really imagine I wanted to
keep you chained to the desk all the
summer!'</p>

<p>She took my hand in both of hers and
stroked it gently.</p>

<p>'I would rather never go on the hills
again than seem ungrateful to you, Mr.
Maude.'</p><p><span class="pagenum">[223]</span></p>

<p>'Ungrateful, child! You don't know how
your little sunbeam face has brightened this
old room.'</p>

<p>'Has it, really?' She seemed pleased,
but rather puzzled. 'Well, I'm very glad,
but that doesn't make it any the less kind of
you to teach me.'</p>

<p>'There has been no kindness at all on my
side, I assure you.'</p>

<p>She shook her head, and her curly hair
touched my shoulder.</p>

<p>'Yes, there has, and I like to think that
there has. Nobody knows how good you
are but Ta-ta and me; we often talk about
you when we're out together, don't we,
Ta-ta?'</p>

<p>The collie wagged her tail violently,
taking this little bit of affectionate conversation
as a welcome relief to the monotony of
our studies.</p>

<p>'Well, I shall leave Ta-ta with you,<span class="pagenum">[224]</span>
then, to keep my memory green while I'm
away.'</p>

<p>'Away! Are you going away?'</p>

<p>'Yes. I am going to Norway for the
summer.'</p>

<p>I could not tell exactly when I made up
my mind to this, but I know that I had had
no intention of the kind when Babiole came
into my study that afternoon. She remained
quite silent for a few minutes. Then she
asked softly&mdash;</p>

<p>'When will you come back, Mr. Maude?'</p>

<p>'Oh, about&mdash;September, I think.'</p>

<p>'The place won't seem the same without
you.'</p>

<p>'Why, child, when you are about on the
hills I never see you.'</p>

<p>'No, but&mdash;but I always have a feeling that
the good genius is about, and&mdash;do you know,
I think I shall be afraid to take such long
walks alone with Ta-ta when you're not here!'</p><p><span class="pagenum">[225]</span></p>

<p>My heart went out to the child. With a
passionate joy in the innocent trust one little
human creature felt towards me, the outcast,
I was on the point of telling her, as carelessly
as I could, that I had not quite made up my
mind yet, when she broke the spell as unwittingly
as she had woven it.</p>

<p>'Oh, Mr. Maude,' she cried, with fervent
disappointment; 'then your friends&mdash;Mr.
Scott&mdash;and the rest&mdash;they won't come here
this year?'</p>

<p>'No,' said I coolly, but with no sign of
the sudden chill her words had given me, 'I
shall invite them to Norway this year.'</p>

<p>Before April was over I had installed Mrs.
Ellmer as caretaker at Larkhall, and, with
Ferguson at my heels, had set out on my
wanderings again.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p>If I went away to appease the restlessness
which had attacked me so suddenly, to persuade
myself that the secret of happiness for
me lay in never remaining long in the same
place, I succeeded badly.</p>

<p>It was not until I was three hundred miles
away from them that I began fully to appreciate
the joys of domestic life with To-to and
Ta-ta, the comfort of being able to keep my
books together, the supreme blessing of sitting
every evening in the same arm-chair.
I was surprised by this at first, till I reflected
that the very loneliness of my life was bound
to bring middle age upon me early. There<span class="pagenum">[227]</span>
was a period of each day which I found it
very hard to get through; whether in Paris,
enjoying coffee and cigarette at a caf&eacute; on
the boulevards, or in Norway, watching the
sunset on some picturesque fiord, when
the day began to wane I grew restless,
and, referring aimlessly to my watch again
and again, could settle down to nothing
till the last rays of daylight had faded
away.</p>

<p>My four friends, when they joined me for
our yearly holiday, all decided that something
was wrong, but that was as far as they could
agree. For while both Fabian and Edgar
said that it was 'liver,' the former recommended
camel-exercise in the Soudan, the
latter would hear of nothing but porridge and
Strathpeffer. And though both the fat Mr.
Fussell and the lean Mr. Browne leaned to
the sentimental view that love and Mrs.
Ellmer were at the root of my malady, the<span class="pagenum">[228]</span>
latter suggested that to shut Mr. Ellmer up
with a hogshead of new whisky and then to
marry his widow would quench my passion
effectually, while Mr. Fussell, with an indescribable
smile, told me to go back to Paris
and 'enjoy myself'; and, if I didn't know
how, I was to take him.</p>

<p>I did none of these things, however, but
after my friends had returned to England, I
wandered about until late October. But when
the days grew short again, the home-hunger
grew irresistibly strong, and I went back to
the Highlands, as a gambler goes back to the
cards. Of course I knew what took me
there, just when the hills were growing bleak,
and the deer had gone to their winter retreat
in the forests. I wanted to see that girl's
face in my study again, to hear the young
voice that rang with youth and happiness
and every quality that makes womanhood
sweet and loveworthy in a man's mind. She<span class="pagenum">[229]</span>
might conjugate Latin verbs or tell me her
young girl love affairs, as she had done sometimes
with ringing laughter, but I must hear
her voice again.</p>

<p>So I arrived at Ballater without warning,
and leaving Ferguson at the station to order
a fly and come on with my luggage, I walked
to Larkhall in the dusk. There was a lamp
in the study; I could see it plainly enough,
for the blind was not drawn down. I saw a
figure pass between the window and the
light; in another minute the front door
opened, and Ta-ta rushed at me, leaping
on to my shoulders, and barking joyously;
while Babiole herself, scarcely less
fleet of foot, seized both my hands, crying
in joyous welcome&mdash;</p>

<p>'Mr. Maude! Mr. Maude! Mr. Maude!'</p>

<p>I said, 'How are you? I hope you are
quite well. Isn't it cold?' But, indeed, no
furnace-fire could have sent such a glow<span class="pagenum">[230]</span>
through my veins as the warm-hearted
pressure of the girl's hands.</p>

<p>'Do you know, I have a sort of feeling
that I <i>knew</i> you were coming to-day? The
Scotch believe in second sight; perhaps it's
a gift of the country. I've had all day a
presentiment that something was going to
happen&mdash;something <i>nice</i>, you know; and just
now, before you were near enough for me to
hear your step, some impulse made me get
up and look out of the window. And, Mr.
Maude, don't you believe mamma if she
says Ta-ta moved first, because she didn't;
it was I. There's always something in the
air before the good genius appears, you
know.'</p>

<p>And she laughed very happily as she led
me in and gravely introduced me to her
mother. Both had been knitting stockings
for me, and I thought the study had never
looked so warm or so home-like as it did<span class="pagenum">[231]</span>
with their work-baskets and wools about, and
with these two good little women making
kindly welcoming uproar around me. To-to
broke his chain, and climbed up on my
shoulder, snarling and showing his teeth
jealously at Babiole. The delighted clamour
soothed my ears as no prima donna's singing
had ever done. That evening I could have
embraced Mrs. Ellmer with tenderness.</p>

<p>Next day I was alone in the drawing-room,
the ladies having given up possession
of the Hall and returned to the cottage, when
I heard footsteps at the open door and a
voice&mdash;</p>

<p>'May I come in, Mr. Maude?'</p>

<p>'Certainly.'</p>

<p>I was busy putting up two paintings of
Norwegian scenery in place of the portraits
of Lady Helen, which were on the ground
against the wall. On seeing my occupation,
Babiole uttered a short cry of surprise and<span class="pagenum">[232]</span>
dismay. I said nothing, but put my head on
one side to see if one of my new pictures was
hung straight. At last she spoke&mdash;</p>

<p>'Oh, Mr. Maude!' was all she said, in a
tone of timid reproach.</p>

<p>'Well.'</p>

<p>'You're not going to take her down after
all this time?'</p>

<p>'You see I have taken her down.'</p>

<p>'Oh, why?' It was not curiosity; it was
entreaty.</p>

<p>'Don't you think she's been up there long
enough?'</p>

<p>'If you were the woman and she were the
man you wouldn't say that.'</p>

<p>'What should I say?'</p>

<p>'You would say, "He's been up there so
long that, whatever he's done, he may as well
stay there now."'</p>

<p>'That would be rather contemptuous tolerance,
wouldn't it?'</p><p><span class="pagenum">[233]</span></p>

<p>'But the picture wouldn't know that; and
if the original should ever grow sorry for all
the harm she&mdash;he had done, it would be something
to know that the picture still hung there
just the same.'</p>

<p>The story must have leaked out, then&mdash;the
first part through Fabian, probably, and
the rest through the divorce court columns of
the daily papers. I said nothing in answer
to the girl's pleadings, but I restored the
portraits to their old places with the excuse
that the landscapes would look better in the
dining-room.</p>

<p>Our studies began again that very afternoon.
Babiole had forgotten nothing, though
work had, of course, grown slack during the
hot days of the summer. She had had another
and rather absorbing love affair, too,
the details of which I extracted with the
accompaniment of more blushes than in the
old days.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[234]</span></p>

<p>'We shall have you getting married and
flying away from us altogether, I suppose,
now, before we know where we are.'</p>

<p>'No,' she protested stoutly, 'I'm not going
to marry; I am going to devote myself to art.'</p>

<p>Upon this I made her fetch her sketch-book,
after promising 'not to tell mamma,'
who might well be forgiven for a prejudice
against any more members of her family
sacrificing themselves to this Juggernaut.
The sketches were all of fir and larch-tree,
hillside and rippling stony Dee; some were
in pencil, some in water-colour; there was
love in every line of each of the little pictures,
and there was something more.</p>

<p>'Why, Babiole, you're going to be a great
artist, I believe,' I cried, as I noticed the
vigour of the outlines, the imaginative charm
of the treatment of her favourite corners of
rock and forest.</p>

<p>'Oh no, not that,' she said deprecatingly.<span class="pagenum">[235]</span>
'If I can be only a little one I shall be satisfied.
I should never dare to draw the big
hills. When I get on those hills along the
Gairn and see the peaks rising the one behind
the other all round me, I feel almost as if I
ought to fall on my knees only to look at
them; it is only when we have crept down
into some cleft full of trees, where I can peep
at them from round a corner, that I feel I can
take out my paper and my paint-box without
disrespect.'</p>

<p>'But you can be a great artist without
painting great things. You may paint Snowdon
so that it is nothing better than a drawing-master's
copy, and you may paint a handful
of wild flowers so that it may shame acres
of classical pot-boilers hung on the line at the
Royal Academy.'</p>

<p>Babiole was thoughtfully silent for some
minutes after this, while I turned over the
rest of her drawings.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[236]</span></p>

<p>'Drawing-master's copy!' she repeated
slowly at last. 'Then a drawing-master is a
man who doesn't draw very well, or who
isn't very particular how he teaches what he
knows?'</p>

<p>'Yes, without being very severe I think
we may say that.'</p>

<p>'That is not like your teaching, Mr.
Maude.'</p>

<p>'What do you mean?'</p>

<p>'Why, all these months that you've been
away I've had a lot of time to think, and I
see what a different thing you have made of
life to me by teaching me to understand
things. Last year I thought of nothing
when I was out on the hills with Ta-ta but
childish things&mdash;stories and things like that.
And now all the while I think of the things
that are going on in the great world, the
pictures that are being painted, the books
that are being written.'</p><p><span class="pagenum">[237]</span></p>

<p>'And the dresses that are being worn?' I
suggested playfully, not at all sure that the
change she was so proud of was entirely for
the better.</p>

<p>'Well, yes, I think I should like to
know that too,' she admitted, with a
blush.</p>

<p>'And you want to attribute all that to my
teaching?'</p>

<p>'Yes, Mr. Maude,' she answered, laughing;
'you must bear the blame of it all.'</p>

<p>'Well, look here; I've re-visited the world
since you have, and, believe me, you are much
better outside. It's a horrid, over-crowded,
noisy place, and, as for the artists in whom
you are so much interested, you must worship
them from afar if you want to worship them
at all. Painters, actors, writers, and the rest&mdash;the
successful ones are snobs, the unsuccessful&mdash;sponges.
And as for the dresses,
my child, there was never a frock sent out of<span class="pagenum">[238]</span>
Bond Street so pretty, so tasteful, or so becoming
as the one you have on.'</p>

<p>But Babiole glanced down at her blue
serge gown rather disdainfully, and there
shone in her eyes, as brightly as ever, that
vague hunger of a woman's first youth for
emotions and pleasures, which every morning's
sunshine seemed to promise her, and
whose names she did not know.</p>

<p>'Ah,' she said gaily, 'but everybody
doesn't speak like that. I shall wait until
your friends come in the summer, and see
what they tell me about it.'</p>

<p>My face clouded, and, with the pretty
affectionateness with which she now always
treated me, she assured me that she did not
really want any advice but mine, and that, as
long as I was good enough to teach her, she
was content to read the lessons of the busy
world through my eyes.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, however, I was myself, through<span class="pagenum">[239]</span>
those same eyes of mine, learning a far more
dangerous lesson, and one, unluckily, which I
could never hope to impart to any woman.
I had no one but myself to thank for my
folly, into which I had coolly walked with
my eyes open. But the temptation to direct
that fair young mind had been too strong for
me, and, having once indulged in the pleasure,
the few months away had but increased
my craving to taste it again. This second
winter we worked even harder than the first.
Babiole, with her expanding mind, and the
passionate excitement she began to throw
into every pursuit, became daily a more fascinating
pupil. She would slide down from
her chair on to a footstool at my side when
discussion grew warm between us concerning
an interesting chapter we had been reading.
She would put her hand on my shoulder with
affectionate persuasion if I disagreed with
her, or tap my fingers impatiently to hurry<span class="pagenum">[240]</span>
my expression of opinion. How could she
know that the ugly grave man, with furrows
in his scarred face, and already whitening
hair, was young and hot-blooded too, with
passions far stronger than hers, and all the
stronger from being iron-bound?</p>

<p>Sometimes I felt tempted to let her know
that I was twenty years younger than she,
growing up in the belief of her childhood
on that matter, innocently thought. But it
could make no difference, in the only way in
which I cared for it to make a difference, and
it might render her constrained with me.
After all, it was my comparative youth which
enabled me to enter into her feelings, as no
dry-as-dust professor of fifty could have done,
and it was upon that sympathy that the bond
between us was founded. In the happiness
this companionship brought to me, I thought
I had lulled keener feelings to sleep, when,
as spring came back, and I was beginning<span class="pagenum">[241]</span>
again to dread the return of the long days,
an event happened which made havoc of the
most cherished sentiments of all three of us.</p>

<p>The first intimation of this revolution was
given by Ferguson, who informed me at
luncheon, with a solemnly indignant face,
that a 'varra disreputable-looking person'
had been pestering him with inquiries for
Mr. Maude, and, after having the door shut
in his face had taken himself off, so Ferguson
feared, in the direction of the cottage, to
bother the ladies. My butler's dislike of
Mrs. Ellmer had broken down under her
constant assistance to Janet.</p>

<p>'I saw that Jim was aboot the stable, sir,
so I have nae doot he helped the gentleman
awa' safe eno',' added Ferguson grimly.</p>

<p>I thought no more of the incident, which
the butler had reported simply because up
among the hills the sight of an unknown face
is an event.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[242]</span></p>

<p>But at four o'clock Babiole did not appear;
I sat waiting, looking through the pages of
Green's <i>Short History of the English People</i>,
on which we were then engaged, for twenty
minutes; and then, almost alarmed at such
an unusual occurrence, I was getting up to
go and make inquiries at the cottage when I
heard her well-known footstep through the
open hall-door. Even before she came in I
knew that something had happened, for instead
of running in all eager, laughing
apology, as was her way on the rare occasions
when she was a few minutes late, I
heard her cross the hall very slowly and hesitate
at the door.</p>

<p>'Come in, come in, Babiole; what's the
matter?' I cried out impatiently.</p>

<p>She came in then quickly, and held out
her hand to me as she wished me good-afternoon.
But there was no smile on her face, and
the light seemed to have gone out of her eyes.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[243]</span></p>

<p>'What is it, child? Something has happened,'
said I, as I drew her down into her
usual chair.</p>

<p>She shook her head, and tried to laugh,
but suddenly broke down, and, bursting into
tears, leaned her face against her hands and
sobbed bitterly.</p>

<p>I was horribly distressed. I tried some
vague words of consolation for the unknown
evil, and laid my hand lightly on one heaving
shoulder, only to withdraw it as if seared by
the touch. Then I sat down quietly and
waited, while Ta-ta, more daring, set up a
kindly howl of sympathetic lamentation,
which happily caused a diversion.</p>

<p>'I ought to be ashamed of myself,' she
said, sitting upright, and drying her eyes.
'I don't know what you must think of me,
Mr. Maude.'</p>

<p>'I don't think anything of you,' I said at
random, being far too much distressed by her<span class="pagenum">[244]</span>
unhappiness to think of any words more
appropriate. 'Now, tell me, what is the
matter?'</p>

<p>I was in no hurry for the answer, for I
had already a very strong presentiment what
it would be.</p>

<p>'Papa has found us out; he's at the cottage
now.'</p>

<p>But he was even nearer, as a heavy tread
on the stone steps outside the front door at
this moment told us. Babiole jumped up,
with her cheeks on fire and her lips parted,
rather as if prepared for the onslaught of a
mad bull.</p>

<p>'H'm, h'm, no one about! And no
knocker!' we heard a thick voice say imperiously,
as my town-bred visitor stumped
about the steps.</p>

<p>'Look here, Babiole; I think you'd better
go, dear. Run through the back door, and
comfort mamma.'</p><p><span class="pagenum">[245]</span></p>

<p>There was no use disguising the fact that
our visitor's arrival was a common calamity.
She made one step away, but then turned
back, clasped my right hand tightly, and
whispered&mdash;</p>

<p>'Remember, you don't see him at his
best. He's a very, very clever man, indeed&mdash;at
home.'</p>

<p>Then she ran lightly away, without looking
at me again, half-conscious, I am afraid,
poor child, that her apology was but a lame
one. I rose, and went to the hall to invite
my visitor in.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII</h2>

<p>Mr. Ellmer's appearance had not improved
with the lapse of years. He was dressed in
the same brown overcoat that he had worn
when I made his acquaintance seven years
ago. It had been new then, it was very old,
worn, and greasy now; still, I think it must
have been in the habit of lying by for long
periods, out of its owner's reach, or it could
scarcely have held together so well. Mr.
Ellmer wore a round-topped felt hat, a size
too large for him, with a very wide and
rather curly brim, from under which his
long fair hair, which had the appearance
of being kept in order by the occasional<span class="pagenum">[247]</span>
application of pomatum rather than by the
constant use of the comb, fell down over a
paper collar in careless profusion. The
same change for the worse was apparent
in the man himself. His face was more
bloated, his look more shifting, the whole
man was more sodden and more swaggering
than he had been seven years ago. If it had
not been for the two poor little women so
unluckily bound to him, I would not have
tolerated such a repulsive creature even on
my doorstep; but for the sake of making
such terms with him as would rid us all of
his obnoxious presence, I held out my hand,
which he, after a moment's hesitation, took
and dropped out of his fat flabby palm, with
a look of horror at my scarred face.</p>

<p>'Will you come in?' said I, leading the
way into the study, which he examined on
entering with undisguised and contemptuous
disappointment.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[248]</span></p>

<p>'Have you come far to-day, Mr. Ellmer?'
I asked, handing him a chair, which I inwardly
resolved for the future to dispense
with, having sentimental feelings about the
furniture of my favourite room.</p>

<p>'Yes, well I may say I have. All the
way from Aberdeen. And it's a good pull
up here from the station to a gentleman
who's not used to much walking exercise.'</p>

<p>He spoke in a low thick voice, very
difficult to hear and understand, his eyes
wandering furtively from one object to
another all the time.</p>

<p>'Did you have much difficulty in finding
the place?'</p>

<p>'Oh yes. She had taken care to hide
herself well.' And his face slowly contracted
with a lowering and brutal expression.
'She thought I shouldn't find them
up here. But I swore I would, and when I
swear a thing it's as good as done.'</p><p><span class="pagenum">[249]</span></p>

<p>'I hope you found your wife and daughter
looking well.'</p>

<p>'Oh, <i>they</i>'re well enough, of course; trust
them to get fat and flourishing, while their
husband and father may be starving!'</p>

<p>Now this was laughable; for whatever
defects Mr. Ellmer's appearance might have,
the leanness of starvation was not one of
them.</p>

<p>'They were by no means fat and flourishing
when I first met them, I assure you,'
I said gravely.</p>

<p>The brute turned his eyes on me with
slow and sullen ferocity.</p>

<p>'That was not my fault, sir,' he whispered
with affected humility, being evidently far
too stupid to know how his looks belied his
words. 'They had been away from me for
some time; my wife left me because I was
unable to support her in luxury, the depression
in art being very great at this moment,<span class="pagenum">[250]</span>
sir. She took my child away from me to
teach her to hate her own father, and to
bring her up in her own extravagant notions.'</p>

<p>'She has cured herself of those now,'
I said; 'she lives on the barest sum necessary
to keep two people alive. It is, unfortunately,
all I can spare her for her kindness
in taking care of my cottage.'</p>

<p>This was true. I had often regretted
that the poor lady's inflexible independence
had made her refuse to accept more than
enough for her and her daughter, with the
strictest economy, to live upon. Now, I
rejoiced to think that she had absolutely no
savings to be sucked down into the greedy
maw of the creature before me. My words
were evidently the echo to some statement
that had been already made to him. Naturally,
he believed neither his wife nor me.</p>

<p>'It's an astonishing thing, then, that a
woman should leave her husband just to<span class="pagenum">[251]</span>
come and live like an old alms-house woman
in a tumble-down cottage fifty miles farther
than nowhere!'</p>

<p>I said nothing; indeed, I could not share
his astonishment.</p>

<p>He went on with rising bluster, and
louder, huskier voice.</p>

<p>'And look here, if I hadn't heard this
great talk of your being such a gentleman, I
don't know whether I shouldn't feel it my
duty to call you to account.'</p>

<p>I rose to my feet, unable to sit still, but at
once sat down again, afraid lest I might not
be able to resist the advantage a standing
position afforded for taking him by the collar
and removing him to the flower-beds outside.</p>

<p>'You are at liberty to satisfy your marital
anxiety by making any inquiries you please,'
said I, and looked at the door.</p>

<p>'Don't be affronted, it was only chaff,'<span class="pagenum">[252]</span>
said he. 'I know it's my daughter you're
after. I saw her sneak out of here just as I
came in by the back-way, as if ashamed to
look her father in the face.'</p>

<p>'You d&mdash;&mdash;d scoundrel! Get up and get
out of the house,' I hissed out in a flash of
uncontrollable rage.</p>

<p>He got up, and even made one slow step
towards the door; but he did not go out,
nor did he seem afraid of me. He turned
deliberately when he was close to the screen,
and began to swing his walking-stick in the
old way I remembered, regardless of the
consequences in a room crowded with furniture
and ornaments. Then he looked into
his hat, and passed his hand thoughtfully
round the lining. I was still at a white heat
of indignation, but to lay violent hands on
this stodgy and unresisting person would
have been like football without the fun.</p>

<p>'Look here,' he said, when we had stood<span class="pagenum">[253]</span>
in this unsatisfactory manner for some moments.
His eyes were fixed upon his hat,
round which his podgy hand still wandered.
'You're not taking me the right way. You
don't like me, I can see. Well, one gentleman
isn't bound to fly into the arms of
another gentleman first go-off. Not at all;
I don't expect it. I may like you, and I
may not like you; but I don't fly at your
throat and call you bad names by way of
introducing myself, even though I do find
my wife and daughter hiding away under the
shadow of your wing, as it were, from their
own husband and father.'</p>

<p>Here he looked up at me sideways with a
slow nod, to emphasise the little lesson in
good breeding which his example afforded.</p>

<p>Perceiving some show of reason in his
words, and some touch of more genuine
feeling in his manner, I said, 'Well!' and
leaned against the chimney-piece. With<span class="pagenum">[254]</span>
this encouragement he stepped back to the
hearthrug again, and while To-to half-strangled
himself in futile attempts to get
at his trousers, he addressed to me the
following discourse, with the forefinger of
his right hand upraised, and the dusty point
of his cane planted deeply in a satin cushion
which Babiole had embroidered for my
favourite chair.</p>

<p>'Look here,' he said, and for once his dull
round eyes met mine with the straightforwardness
of an honest conviction. 'Full-grown
women are the devil. Either they're
good or they're bad. If they're bad&mdash;well,
we need say no more about them; if they're
good, why&mdash;the less said about their goodness
the better. But a young girl, before
she's learnt a woman's tricks&mdash;and especially
if she's your own flesh and blood&mdash;why that's
different! And my little girl, for all she
shows none too much affection for her father<span class="pagenum">[255]</span>
(but that's her mother's doing), she's a little
picture, and I'm proud of her. And if
any infernal cad of a d&mdash;&mdash;d gentleman was
to be up to any nonsense with her, and
so much as to put his&mdash;hand on her
pretty little head&mdash;look here, Mr. What-d'ye-call-'em,
I'd make a d&mdash;&mdash;d pulp of him!'</p>

<p>And Mr. Ellmer gripped my coat with a
fierceness and looked into my face with a
resolution which, in spite of the coarseness
which had disfigured his speech, warmed my
heart towards him. For, instead of the
contemptible sodden cur of a few minutes ago,
it was a man,&mdash;degraded by his course of
life, but still a man, with a spark of the right
fire in his heart,&mdash;who stood blinking steadily
at me with a persistency which demanded an
answer.</p>

<p>I freed my coat from his grasp, but without
any show of annoyance, and answered
him simply at once.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[256]</span></p>

<p>'You won't have to make pulp of anybody
while your daughter lives at Ballater, Mr.
Ellmer. I have watched her grow from a
child into&mdash;into what she is now, something&mdash;to
us who love her&mdash;between a fairy and an
angel; and no father could take deeper
interest in his own child than I do in her.'</p>

<p>'Deeper interest,' repeated Mr. Ellmer
dubiously; 'No; I daresay not. But,
excuse me, Mr.&mdash;Mr.&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Maude.'</p>

<p>'Yes, Mr. Maude, no offence to you, but
you're a man yourself, you know.'</p>

<p>After the contumely with which he had
treated me, the admission seemed quite a
compliment. I made no attempt to deny it,
and this reticence emboldened him.</p>

<p>'Now, why don't you marry her yourself?'</p>

<p>To have the wish which has been secretly
gnawing at the foundations of your heart<span class="pagenum">[257]</span>
suddenly brought face to face with you is
a startling and confounding experience. I
think no convicted ruffian can ever have
looked more guiltily ashamed of himself than
I, as I felt the hot blood mount to my head,
and my brain swim with the first full consciousness
of a futile passion. Of course,
the man before me put the worst construction
upon my evident confusion; he repeated in
a louder and more blustering tone&mdash;</p>

<p>'Why don't you marry her?'</p>

<p>'In the first place,' said I quietly, 'she is
scarcely more than a child, Mr. Ellmer.'</p>

<p>'That's not much of a fault, for she won't
improve as she loses it. Besides, you needn't
marry her at once.'</p>

<p>'In the second place, I am quite sure she
wouldn't have me.'</p>

<p>'Why not? She seems to like you.'</p>

<p>'She does like me, as a beautiful girl may
like a grandfather, battered and scarred in<span class="pagenum">[258]</span>
war, or a homeless cur which she has picked
up and which has grown attached to her.
To be frank with you, Mr. Ellmer, nothing
but my ugly face prevents me from becoming
a suitor for your daughter; but that obstacle
is one which, without any undue self-depreciation,
I know to be one which makes
happy marriage impossible for me.'</p>

<p>'I don't know,' said Mr. Ellmer, in a
tone of generous encouragement; 'good
looks don't always carry it off with the
women. Look at my wife, now: well, to be
sure, she was proud enough of getting me;
but, do you think the feeling lasted? No, I
might have been a one-eyed hunchback, sir,
before we'd been man and wife three months!
There's no knowing what those creatures will
like, let alone the fact that they never like
the same thing more than a week together&mdash;barring
a miracle.'</p>

<p>And Mr. Ellmer looked at me, with his<span class="pagenum">[259]</span>
head a little on one side, as if expecting that
the narration of his experience would conclusively
affect my views on matrimony. As
I said nothing, however, being, indeed, too
much involved in a whirlpool of doubts and
longings and miserable certainties to have
any neatly-turned phrases ready with which
to carry on the conversation, he presently
cleared his throat and went on again.</p>

<p>'You see,' he said, with an odd assumption
of paternal dignity, which covered some
genuine feeling as well as some genuine
humbug, 'it isn't often that I can spare the
time to take a journey as long as this.
Therefore, when I do, I like to see something
for my trouble. Well, and what I
mean to see this time is one of two things:
either I leave with the knowledge that my
daughter is engaged to be married to an
honourable gentleman who is able to support
her, and willing to be good to her, or I leave<span class="pagenum">[260]</span>
with my daughter herself, and I put her in
the way of earning her own living on the
stage, which is a more honourable position
than playing lodgekeeper to any gentleman
in the land.'</p>

<p>'And you would take her mother with her,
of course?' I said, as easily as I could, with
a sudden gloomy misgiving that Babiole,
happy as she was among the hills, would
snatch at the chance of rushing into the
conflicts of the busier life in which she took
such an ominous interest.</p>

<p>'Oh, she can do as she likes,' answered
Mr. Ellmer with a sudden return, at mention
of his wife, to sullen and brutal ferocity of
look and tone.</p>

<p>I was horrorstruck at the possibility of
my little fairy choosing to leave the shelter
of the hillside under the protection of this
man, whose caprice of paternal pride and
affection might, I thought, at any moment of<span class="pagenum">[261]</span>
drunken irritation or disappointment, change
to the selfish cruelty with which he had
treated his hard-working wife.</p>

<p>'Will you give me till to-morrow morning
to think about it, and to speak to Babiole,
Mr. Ellmer?' I asked, after a few moments'
rapid thought. 'In the meantime we will do
our best to make you comfortable, either
here or at the cottage. Of course, I cannot
prevent your saying what you please to your
daughter, but I hope you will, in fairness to
me, let me plead my own cause unbiassed by
one word from you. The subject is one I
know she has never dreamed of, and it will
surprise and may even startle her very much.
So that I may ask so much of you, and beg
you to rely on my discretion.'</p>

<p>Mr. Ellmer seemed pleased with the
success of his diplomacy, and he offered me
a fat, pink, lazy hand to shake.</p>

<p>'Say no more, sir; between gentlemen<span class="pagenum">[262]</span>
that is quite sufficient. And I should like to
add, sir, that if everything should turn out
as we both desire, you need have no fear of
being put upon by your wife's relations, whatever
Babiole's mother may say. The votaries
of Art, sir, are used to poverty, and need not
blush for it. But I should be glad to think
that my devotion to it had brought only its
dignity, and not its penalties, upon my
daughter.'</p>

<p>I shook his hand heartily, almost feeling,
for the moment, so deep was his own conviction,
that this greasy person with the
paper collar&mdash;whose language and sentiments,
like an untuned musical instrument,
could rise and fall to such unexpected heights
and depths&mdash;was really treating me with a
generous condescension for which I ought to
be grateful.</p>

<p>I accompanied him to the door, and
watched his ponderous figure making its way<span class="pagenum">[263]</span>
to the cottage, near the entrance of which I
saw his wife waiting for him; then I whistled
to Ta-ta, who had followed the stranger for
a few steps in order to get a better view of
his retreat, and, taking my hat, went down
the drive for a walk. It was past five, and
the April sun was shining out a fair good-night
to the hills after a day of rain; faint
tufts of pale green were showing on the dark
foliage of the larch-trees, and the daisies in
the soft grass were beginning to take heart
at the death of winter. One could think
better in the fresh spring-scented air than
between walls of solemn books. As for that,
though, my plan of action was already decided
on, and contemplation of it, even under
the inspiration of the perfume of the firs, and
the babble of the water over the stones of
the Dee, resulted in no improvement on my
first idea. This was no less than to make
a formal proposal to Babiole, which she must<span class="pagenum">[264]</span>
accept on the clear understanding that it was
to form no tie upon her, but which would
satisfy her father and allow her to remain
still in the safe shelter of this nook among
the hills. The girl was only fifteen, much too
young for any serious love-ventures of her
own, so that I argued that my engagement
to her would be merely a most loyal guardianship
which would reach its natural end when
the handsome young prince should break his
way through the enchanted forest and wake
her up with the traditional kiss. Hope for
myself, I can assuredly say, I had very little;
and, if this modesty seems excessive in a man
in the very prime of life, who, moreover, had
already some sort of assured place in the
esteem of the girl he loved, I can only say
that there was a balance against me in the
books of the sex which I was paying off to
this one member of it, and, therefore, in proportion
as I had felt myself to be too good<span class="pagenum">[265]</span>
for the rest of those I had met, so I felt that
Babiole Ellmer was too good for me. The
matter was arranged in my own mind with
very little trouble, and I was eager to unfold
it to her. I had half expected to find her in
the road through the fir-forest, knowing that
after the day's rain the little maid must be
thirsting for a long draught of the fresh
sweet air&mdash;but no; I passed through it and
out into the open country, over the stone
bridge of Muick, skirted the Dee and crossed
it again by Ballater Bridge into the village,
without a glimpse of her.</p>

<p>The sun was getting low behind the hills
when I reached the western foot of Craigendarroch,
and, without a pause, began to climb
between the glistening branches of the budding
oak-trees up to the top. I had no
distinct purpose in coming so far, and the
faint bark of my own dog, which reached my
ears as I was ascending the bare and rocky<span class="pagenum">[266]</span>
space which separates the oak-grown lower
slope from the fir-crowned summit of the hill,
caused me to stop suddenly in surprise and
excitement so sharp and so sudden that all
the blood in my body seemed to rush to my
head, and my heart to continue its action by
unwonted, tumultuous leaps.</p>

<p>I pulled myself together, not without some
consternation at the phenomenon.</p>

<p>'I came up the hill too fast,' I said to
myself, and crept up the slabs of rock that
now formed a wet and slippery footway
among the firs, with a sensation of horror at
the thought of Babiole's trusting her little
feet on such a treacherous path.</p>

<p>At the top, a little way beyond the cairn,
I came upon her suddenly. She was sitting
on the trunk of a fallen tree, looking out to
the western hills, across the slopes of which
were lying dense, cloud-like mists, white
against the blackness of the darkening hillsides.<span class="pagenum">[267]</span>
The last red rays of the sinking sun
threw upon her face a weird unnatural glow,
and caused her moist eyes to glisten like
strange gems in the sun-lit marble of her
still features. The wild sweet sadness of
her expression, like that of a gentle animal
who has been stricken, and does not know
why, brought a lump into my throat, and
caused me to halt at some distance from her
with a feeling of shy respect.</p>

<p>Ta-ta, who sat by her side, with a sensitively-dilating
nose on the young girl's knee,
saw me at once, but merely wagged her tail
as an apologetic intimation that I must
excuse her from attendance on me, as she
had weightier business on hand than mere
idle frisking about my heels.</p>

<p>But the movement in her companion attracted
Babiole's attention; she turned her
head, saw me, and started up.</p>

<p>The spell was broken; she was in a<span class="pagenum">[268]</span>
moment the sweet smiling Babiole of every
day. But I could not so soon get over the
shock of the first sight of her face: I had
seemed to read vague prophecies in the wide
sad eyes. I smiled and held out my hand,
but I left it to her to open the conversation.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<p>'It's very nice up here, isn't it, Mr. Maude?'
Babiole said, after a few seconds' search for
an opening remark.</p>

<p>'But it's much too late for you to be out
here by yourself.'</p>

<p>'Yes. I had forgotten it was so late,'
she said humbly, with a sensitive blush at
my mild reproof. 'Poor mamma wanted to
be quiet, and told me to go out; so I came
here.'</p>

<p>She was winding about her the thick plaid
she always carried when the weather was
cold; and this, when adjusted Highland
fashion across the shoulder, made her, in<span class="pagenum">[270]</span>
conjunction with the knitted Tam-o'-Shanter
cap she wore, a most picturesque and appropriate
figure among the dead heather and
the fir-trees.</p>

<p>'You look like Helen M'Gregor,' said I,
smiling.</p>

<p>She smiled back brightly, but shook her
head.</p>

<p>'I haven't courage enough for myself,
much less enough to inspire anybody else
with,' she said rather sadly.</p>

<p>'Courage is a thing you can't measure
until you have to use it. What makes you
think you have none, Babiole? I feel sure
you have a great deal.'</p>

<p>She began to laugh, in the shyest, sweetest,
prettiest way; and, putting her hand on
the stout stick I carried, she twisted it round
and round in the earth, and looked up in my
face affectionately.</p>

<p>'Yes, yes, I know. That is the way you<span class="pagenum">[271]</span>
always teach me. You told me I was intelligent
and industrious, until I began to be
both; and I daresay, if you were to tell me
long enough,&mdash;in your own kind way, helping
me on by your own strong wish,&mdash;that I
was brave, why I should become so. But
I'm not now.'</p>

<p>'Tell me how you know that.'</p>

<p>'Well, to-day I only heard of something
that&mdash;that would be very hard to bear, and I
broke down altogether.'</p>

<p>'What was it?'</p>

<p>No answer.</p>

<p>'Was it something your father said?'</p>

<p>She looked up with a flash of inquiry in
her eyes.</p>

<p>'Was it something about your going
away from here?'</p>

<p>She answered by a look only; a look that
was timid, mournful, affectionate, and that
had yet another element; for behind all this<span class="pagenum">[272]</span>
tenderness and softness, there danced the
restless yearning of an eager young spirit.</p>

<p>'Well, and haven't I heard certain people
talking about the interesting things that go
on in the world, and hinting that Ballater
was a slow and tiresome old place, where
nothing ever happened worth mentioning?'</p>

<p>She blushed and hung her head a moment,
and then began her defence in a very meek
voice.</p>

<p>'I don't think I've really ever spoken so
ungratefully as that about dear old Ballater.
It's quite true that I should like to see a little
more of the big world outside some day, but
I think I could be content to hear what you
care to tell me about it for a year or two
longer first. The fact is, Mr. Maude,' she
went on, looking up at me with an altogether
irresistible smile of affection and sympathy,
'I could make up my mind to leave the hills,
but I can't make up my mind to leave you.'</p><p><span class="pagenum">[273]</span></p>

<p>What an opening! I began to shiver and
quake and to give signs of such unmistakable
nervousness that Babiole evidently thought I
was going to be taken with a fit of some sort.
She looked helplessly around, and I gave a
laugh like a schoolboy who comes too early
to his first ball.</p>

<p>'I'm not ill, Babiole; I have something to
say to you.'</p>

<p>Upon this she became nearly as much
disturbed as I, and the colour left her sensitive
face, as she sat mutely down on the tree-trunk
again to hear me.</p>

<p>'I&mdash;don't want you to&mdash;go away&mdash;either&mdash;Babiole,'
I jerked out slowly and unsteadily.
'You are very young, and I think
you can afford to wait before seeing the
world,&mdash;if you are not tired of this place and
the people in it. Everybody here likes you,
I may say, loves you; and, at any rate, if the
life is not very exciting, it has no great cares.<span class="pagenum">[274]</span>
But your father, who does not know us so
well as you do, is reluctant to leave you here
without some sort of&mdash;of formal guarantee
for your safety.' Babiole looked up at me
from time to time in bewildered expectancy
of something new and awful.</p>

<p>'Safety!' she echoed in an amazed
whisper.</p>

<p>'Yes. Girls, when they grow to your
age, must have a&mdash;a responsible guardian,
you know. How old are you?'</p>

<p>'I shall be sixteen in July.'</p>

<p>'Well, you see, in a few years you will be
old enough to be married, and your father is
naturally anxious to see you well provided
for: established, you know, settled&mdash;in fact,
married.'</p>

<p>Babiole was growing calmer. On reflection,
of course there was nothing so alarming
in the mention of a woman's natural end as
to justify the horror which one is accustomed<span class="pagenum">[275]</span>
to consider maidenly; but I was surprised at
the time to find that she listened to me so
quietly. I thought it would have helped me
more if she had shied at the subject, so to
speak; some little show of emotion of one
kind or another would have spurred me on
to make a better business of the whole thing
than I was doing. Her eyes, instead of
being raised from time to time inquiringly to
mine, were now fixed on the last faint glow
of sunlight behind the hills; but she said
nothing, and I had to go on.</p>

<p>'He is so bent upon it, in fact, that he says
that, young as you are, he will only let you
remain here longer on one condition.'</p>

<p>She looked up quickly, with a change of
expression which I took for that of vague
apprehension.</p>

<p>'What condition?'</p>

<p>'You must be engaged&mdash;affianced&mdash;to some
one he approves of before he leaves you.'</p><p><span class="pagenum">[276]</span></p>

<p>Babiole began to laugh. 'But papa must
know that that is ridiculous. I am not a
princess, to make so much fuss about. Besides,
I am old enough, mamma says, to stay
with her if I like.'</p>

<p>'We can't complain of your father for
thinking so much of you. And there is a
very simple way of satisfying him, if you
really do care to stay any longer at the old
cottage. Remember, your father could easily
persuade your mother to go away with him
if he were bent on having you; and then the
old life for her would begin again.'</p>

<p>The girl rose to her feet in great excitement.</p>

<p>'What is the simple way?'</p>

<p>'You can become engaged to me.'</p>

<p>I had not prepared her in the least, after
all. She did not start or speak, but I could
see by her face that she was utterly surprised.
I was afraid of a hasty refusal, and now<span class="pagenum">[277]</span>
screwed up to the pitch of daring, I hurried
on without further hesitation.</p>

<p>'You know, Babiole, I am not asking you
to marry me now, or at any future time.
That must be for a handsomer, more dashing
fellow than I. But I want you to understand
that I am your guardian up to the time when
the dashing young fellow turns up; and till
then we will be just as we have always been.
You understand, child, that there is to be no
binding tie on you at all, nothing new except
the understanding that I am answerable to
your father for your safety and happiness.
Now, are you willing to have me?'</p>

<p>I tried to put the question as a joke, but I
was much moved.</p>

<p>She put her hand into mine without at first answering,
but her eyes were full of tears before I had ended.</p>

<p>'I will do whatever you wish, now and
always, Mr. Maude,' she said so sweetly, so<span class="pagenum">[278]</span>
softly, that at once I began to realise the
peril to myself of what I had done, as a great
yearning seized me to draw the little creature
into my arms, and tell her what a poor chance
it was that she would ever find among the
fair-featured sons of men a slave so docile as
I would be for just the right to cherish her.</p>

<p>I wish I had, now.</p>

<p>Then, however, I only said, 'That's right,'
in a strangled voice; and we began to go
down the hill together. But I discovered
that this explanation, which was to have been
so small and simple a thing, had already
changed in some degree the character of our
intercourse. Babiole gave me her hand to
help her down, as freely and simply as she
had often done before; but it seemed to me
now that it was the hand of a fair young
woman, instead of the hand of a child. It
was some change in the girl herself, and not
in me, I felt sure, for I had been fully<span class="pagenum">[279]</span>
conscious of my own love and my own
longings ever since, on my return from Norway,
I had found her still with the sweet
flower-face, but with the form and shy proud
manner of a budding woman. I considered
this phenomenon as we crossed the wild bare
slope beneath the fir-trees, and as we found
our way through the growing darkness of the
oak branches, with the silver water shining
before us in the distance, and the mist
gathering about us as we went down. There
was no touch of coquetry about her manner
whereby I could take courage, but a very
pretty gravity which seemed to denote that
even such a poor thing as a temporary and
make-believe engagement to marry demanded
that one should put away childish things and
talk about the affairs of the nation.</p>

<p>We both enjoyed that walk back to Larkhall
very much; she, because of the delicious
new sense of importance which our secret<span class="pagenum">[280]</span>
understanding gave her; I, because there
was now a link, however frail, between us,
and because I was already deep enough in
the mire to feel that there was but a maimed
poor creature in my place when she was out
of my sight. It was dark when we got into
the drive, and Mr. and Mrs. Ellmer were
both about, peering into bushes, and calling
their daughter in a futile way, rather to fill
up the time when their <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> palled, than
because they really expected to find her
under a rhododendron or a laurel.</p>

<p>'I told you she was all right,' said the lady
sharply, as we came up.</p>

<p>'Aha! Where have you been?' asked
her husband with ponderous roguery.</p>

<p>'On Craigendarroch, papa,' answered
Babiole simply, letting her arm remain in
mine, this being the straightforward way I
had chosen of making known the result of
our meeting.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[281]</span></p>

<p>Mrs. Ellmer was eager to break up the
party, and insisted that Babiole's boots must
be wet, and that she ought to come and
change them. But the artist had something
to say first.</p>

<p>'She won't catch cold. She's been too
well employed, haven't you, Bab?' he asked,
seizing her by the arm, with a laugh that set
her blushing.</p>

<p>I hastened to put a stop to this inquisition.</p>

<p>'She will tell you all about it presently.
I think she had better go with her mother
now, while I speak to you, Mr. Ellmer.'</p>

<p>He let her go, being in high good
humour, consequent upon the discovery and
appropriation of some whisky in his wife's
cupboard. I told him that his daughter had
consented to become engaged to me, and
assured him that I would do my best to make
her happy. He grew a little maudlin over
the hardship of parting with an only daughter,<span class="pagenum">[282]</span>
which, though rather far-fetched, was to be
expected; but he was genuinely glad that
she was well provided for, and took care to
point out to me with some shrewdness that
his pride in his daughter was perfectly disinterested,
as he had been so long a waif and
stray upon the world that the world was considered
by his relations as bound to support
him, even if he had not been, as he was, too
proud to accept from any man more than a
mount when he was footsore, or a drink when
he was thirsty.</p>

<p>I began to feel quite sorry for the poor
beggar, and the feeling was increased later, in
spite of his causing me to pass a most uncomfortable
evening. They all came in to
see me after dinner. Mr. Ellmer watched
Babiole about with great pride, tried her
voice at the piano, on which he performed
with some taste, and declared that it was good
enough for grand opera. On the other hand<span class="pagenum">[283]</span>
he missed no opportunity of snubbing his wife
with ferocity, begged her not to skip, and
advised her to leave her juvenile ways to her
daughter. Poor Babiole spent the evening
in torture. At each word of extravagant
praise to herself she blushed uncomfortably;
at every unkind speech to her mother the
tears came to her eyes. In the climax of her
misery I bore a most unwilling share.</p>

<p>I was bidding them all good-night on the
doorstep, and was shaking hands with
Babiole, when Mr. Ellmer, who had several
times during the evening disconcerted us
both by tactless reference to the supposed
excited state of our feelings, said jocularly,
that that was not the way sweethearts parted
when he was young. Ready to satisfy him,
but afraid to offend or frighten Babiole, I
laughed awkwardly and hesitated, while the
young girl blushed and tried, for the first
time, to withdraw her hand from mine.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[284]</span></p>

<p>'Don't be affected, Bab,' said her father
roughly.</p>

<p>I would have let her go, but at the sharp
words she shivered, and put up her face with
a sob of sensitive terror to mine. I stooped
and kissed her, and if she shrank from the
touch of my trembling lips, or the contact of
my hideous face with her fair cheek, at least
she felt none of the burning bitterness which
seemed to turn my very heart to gall, and the
caress of my hungry lips into a sting. For
the remembrance of the last fair girl I had
kissed, of the languid indifference which had
left her cold to my devotion, rushed into my
brain and gave added venom to this second
and more severe misfortune. She drew away
from me with a new timidity, and ran down
the steps after her mother, while Mr. Ellmer
smoked a last cigar with me in the garden, and
called upon me to condole with him, which,
in the disturbed state of thought and feeling<span class="pagenum">[285]</span>
I was in, I was ready enough to do. For
when he pitifully dilated on the life his acid-tempered
wife had led him, on the coldness
with which she had always repelled instead of
encouraged him, on the martyr-like airs with
which she had received his every attempt to
reform, I felt that I was ready to side with
the most worthless man living against the
most worthy woman, and listened sympathetically;
and when he pointed to the
dutifully subdued fear which shone in his
daughter's eyes, in answer to the gaze of his
own affection, I listened in silence to his
cynical conclusion:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Women, they make you pay by the nose
either way, sir. If they're not honest, they
take it out of your pocket; if they're honest,
they take it out of your heart. But rob you,
one way or another, they all will to the
end.'</p>

<p>And he went off to the cottage in a meek<span class="pagenum">[286]</span>
and maudlin manner, which made his subsequent
conduct a most bewildering surprise.
For, on the following morning, Mrs. Ellmer
was not to be seen, and, on her next appearance
in public some evenings later, it was
evident that her husband had made a forcible
appeal to her memory of old times by giving
her a black eye. In the meantime Babiole
was wild, shy and unapproachable by either
her father or me. This state of affairs being
untenable, and his wife's very small provision
of whisky exhausted, Mr. Ellmer in the
course of the afternoon took a dispirited farewell
of us, armed with a note to the stationmaster
at Aberdeen, which I explained would
obtain him a free railway-pass to London.
He thanked me for my courtesy, but was by
no means disarmed by it. In the midst of a
sentimental leave-taking, he suddenly flashed
up into ferocity as I reminded him that his
wife and daughter were well and safe with<span class="pagenum">[287]</span>
each other, which must be some comfort in
the prolonged absence from them which the
claims of Art forced upon him.</p>

<p>'Well and safe!' he repeated, his face
resuming the brutal lowering look which had,
under the amenities of social intercourse,
sunk into a placid animal contentment.
'Yes, I should hope so. For I can tell
you it would be a bad time for those who
had anything to do with it when my little
girl was anything else but well and safe.'</p>

<p>The man was in earnest,&mdash;genuine brutal
earnest. Without again offering me his hand,
and with merely a nod by way of last salutation,
he left me in the study, where we had
been holding this last interview, with impulsive
abruptness. I sat down and looked at
the fire, glad the man was gone, and thinking
no more of him, but of his fair little daughter,
and of the best means of effacing the uncomfortable
impression made by this violent and<span class="pagenum">[288]</span>
unwelcome irruption into our old harmonious
intercourse.</p>

<p>I had been occupied thus about ten
minutes, disturbed by no sound but the
dashing of the rain of a sharp April shower
against the windows, when the hall-door was
pushed open again, and the hoarse gruff
voice I had hoped to hear no more broke
upon my unwilling ears again.</p>

<p>'Come, no nonsense, aren't you safe with
your own father?' I heard Mr. Ellmer say
angrily, to the accompaniment of plaintive
pleadings and protests from Babiole, whom,
the next moment, he dragged in before me.
He had not waited for her to put on a hat,
but had thrown over her head her mother's
mackintosh, which he now pulled off, leaving
her pretty brown hair tumbling in disorder
about her eyes. She was pitifully shy and
unhappy, poor child, and she shrank back
with crimson cheeks as her father drew her<span class="pagenum">[289]</span>
arm firmly through his, and brought her
close up to me as I stood, in great anger
and perturbation, on the hearthrug.</p>

<p>'Mr. Maude,' he said, 'you will excuse a
father's solicitude.'</p>

<p>He had been making up that opening as
he came along I felt sure, from the pompous
effect with which he produced it. He raised
his hand as I was bursting into an angry
protest, and continued&mdash;</p>

<p>'You have obtained my daughter's consent
and my consent to becoming her
affianced husband.' This, too, was a studied
phrase, brought out with pedantic decision.
'On that understanding I leave her
and her mother in this neighbourhood
with confidence, and I call upon you to
swear&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>But here Babiole broke away from him,
and retreating quickly to the other side of the
table, out of reach of the rough paternal arm,<span class="pagenum">[290]</span>
she cried out, with burning cheeks and
flashing blue eyes&mdash;</p>

<p>'Papa, you are insulting Mr. Maude, and
I can't listen. He has been the best friend
we ever had; nobody knows how good he
is; and now for you, who ought to thank
him,&mdash;honour him for what he has been to
us,&mdash;to talk as if you mistrusted him, as if
we mistrusted him,&mdash;Oh, it is too horrible!
I can't bear it! How can we stay here after
this? How, if we do stay here, can we
look him in the face? He is the best man
in all the world, and the kindest, and the
cleverest; and oh! you might have trusted
him, and not have brought this shame upon
us!'</p>

<p>And the poor child crouched down upon
the nearest chair, and turned away her head
to hide her falling tears.</p>

<p>Her father listened to this outburst with
unmoved pompous stolidity; but as she<span class="pagenum">[291]</span>
sank down, he looked from her to me with
a proud and satisfied glance, as much as to
say, 'Do you observe my daughter's exquisite
sensibility? This is one of the results of a
parent's devotion to Art.'</p>

<p>'Mr. Ellmer, let me walk down the
drive with you,' said I hurriedly, quite
unmanned and nerveless at the sight of
the girl's distress. 'Surely, we can arrange
everything to your satisfaction by
ourselves.'</p>

<p>'There I differ from you,' said he, doggedly
holding his ground, determined to
carry through to the end his own more
dramatic plan of settlement. 'I am a father,
Mr. Maude, and a father's sense of his duty
to his child must be respected. I am not
insensible that you have so far shown yourself
quite the gentleman.'</p>

<p>Babiole, so to speak, curled up at this.</p>

<p>'And therefore I have permitted this<span class="pagenum">[292]</span>
engagement. But I must have it plain that
I hold you responsible for my little girl's
happiness, and that if anything goes wrong
with her, it is you&mdash;you, Mr. Maude&mdash;who
will have to answer for it to me!'</p>

<p>He spoke with savage earnestness which
impressed me, and struck terror into his
daughter, whom he kissed with genuinely
passionate tenderness on both cheeks.</p>

<p>'Good-bye, Bab,' said he; 'be a good
girl, and don't grow too like your mother.
Don't be too sweet to the man you fancy till
he's your husband, and you'll have more
sweetness to spare for him then. Don't
believe your mother when she says your
father's nothing but a blackguard, for he'll
do more for you at a pinch than any of
your beaux. Good-bye, child. God bless
you!'</p>

<p>She kissed him, trembling, with timid
affection answering to his tenderness<span class="pagenum">[293]</span>&mdash;</p>

<p>'Good-bye, papa,' she said, and added in
a whisper, 'Won't you some day live with
mamma and me again? We would try to
make you happy, and I am learning to
understand all about Art.'</p>

<p>'Ah, well, some day perhaps,' he said
hastily, and disengaged himself from her
twining arms.</p>

<p>I thought he was going out without
any further greeting to me, but close to
the door he stopped, and giving me a
stolid frown, jerked his head slowly back
in the direction of his daughter; then,
with a menacing nod to remind me of
his warning, he left the room and the
house. A minute later I saw him blubbering,&mdash;there
is no other word for it,&mdash;like a
great overgrown child as he went down the
drive.</p>

<p>I waited at the window on purpose to
give Babiole time to recover enough serenity<span class="pagenum">[294]</span>
to bridge over the awkwardness of the situation.
The startling necessity of the case
restored her to full self-command much
sooner than I had expected. After a very
few minutes, during which I heard her sobs
die away like a child's into silence, I ventured
to turn round, and found her with red
swollen eyelids and a very sad little face,
but perfectly calm. She rose from her chair
in quite a dignified way, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>'We have kept you from your work, I am
afraid, Mr. Maude,' with the odd primness
which I could remember as one of her earliest
characteristics.</p>

<p>'Not at all. I&mdash;I was not busy,' I
answered, with frozen stiffness.</p>

<p>For the moment I dared not speak to her,
except under this ridiculous mask of frigidity;
such a lot of indiscreet emotions were bubbling
up in me, ready to burst into rash
speech at the first opening. She seemed a<span class="pagenum">[295]</span>
little dismayed by my coldness, and hung her
head in what I knew to be shame at her
father's clumsy show of mistrust.</p>

<p>'Well, you shall have a little peace now at
least,' she said, without looking at me, as she
crossed to the door.</p>

<p>'And to-day's lessons?' I asked rather
abruptly.</p>

<p>'I think I will ask you to excuse me
to-day,' she said in a trembling voice.</p>

<p>'Certainly,' said I, with an involuntary
bow, which caused her to look up and redden
at this unusual ceremoniousness.</p>

<p>The old footing was, for a time at least,
completely destroyed.</p>

<p>'Good-afternoon, Mr. Maude,' she said.</p>

<p>'Good-afternoon,' I repeated.</p>

<p>But, as she took another step and reached
the screen, her shy glance met mine; impulsively
she stretched out her hand. I
seized it, and for one brief minute we looked<span class="pagenum">[296]</span>
straight into each other's eyes with the
frank confidence of our old friendship:
the next, she had broken away, and I was
left alone with silent To-to and sympathetic
Ta-ta.</p>

one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
